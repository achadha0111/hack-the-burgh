We have made the interface very simple where you can choose to nalyse centres individually or together and then will see a dashboard of various metrics for them averaged over the last month. By clicking on a metric you can see its breakdown over several months.We mde this a java applet so that it can run on any platform and used JavaFX to create the GUICollaborating over GitHub for the first time caused many issues in the beginning. We also had trouble designing a GUI and data analysis algorithms before the processing of inputs was complete.We are proud to hve (hopefully) created something which works and provides meaningful information to the user. We hope that the practices used in most of our design are scalable and could be built upon easily to create a nice finished product.We learned how to collaborate over github and also to split work up as a team and communicate with eachother by defining the interfaces between each section before we started the actual code.We hope that this project will be a basis that can be worked on and developed further in the future. We feel that our simple interface is a good idea as it is very visual and makes it easy to judge how well a centre is performing.ChariTechI worked on backend data readingI worked on the front end displayJacobMoxham

The project seemed perfect for our wide-ranging and typically incompatible programming abilities.The dashboard: it displays data. Well, hopefully, it will display data before the deadline- currently, it displays a series of empty boxes.There is a login page which lets you log in. We also have a PHP API to get data metrics using Javascript.Well.. Carlos decided that Javascript libraries were off limits. So he started the process of coding graphs and maps from scratch... David was a champ and did all the PHP. Tristram was also a champ and did HTML and CSS. Henry used MySQL and Java to compute metrics from the data.I sat there for most of the day trying to help. And I did.. sometimes.Carlos. Just use a library.The sidebar is probably the best part of the project. The other stuff comes in at a close second.Carlos learnt that Javascript libraries are helpful. Everyone else learnt that Carlos should use libraries.Future implementations could include machine learning. Perhaps also some graphs.ChariTechI designed the sidebar.And I made a neural network.But it doesn't workAfter working out the different data pages I whipped up some SQL queries to serve some tasty KPIs. Then I attacked the data head on using Java to decypher the time logs into some more informative data. I also provided some top quality snacks and, of course, made use of Excel.I designed the frontend except for the sidebar, as well as combined the different modules that other team members worked on.Ben Curnow

In year 2 you build the next Big Thing and move to California. You are a busy boy/girl, but you want to give to the less fortunate as well. How do you keep up with the changing landscape of altruism around you? You use ChariFlicks, of course. It simplifies the process of giving as far as a simple flick to the right. Just tell ChariFlicks where you are and how you would like to help, and you will be matched to the charity of your dreams.We worked hard, fuelled by KitKats and diet coke.""We are still running into them"", as MP points out, upon being asked. In the beginning the problems mainly had to do with conversion. The idea is, in order to build an altruism dating application, you need a lot of data about the potential matches. So we downloaded the entire database of registered charities in the UK since 1961. Just to mention, they are over 500 000. Before coming up with a way of processing them, we had to extract the information from a format we had never seen before. But perhaps most importantly, THERE IS A LOT OF DATA, and not enough CPU...Our webpage is very pretty (in Professional, we are good at design!). Also we built a scraper to find the postcode of a geographical location.Don't let the databases guy (jrth2) leave early!!!After a few technical tweaks?

The aim is to have an exciting storyline combined with theory and challenges about properties, structures, processing and performance of materials. Scores are given at various points of the game as an incentive to get the right answers on the first attempt. Results can be shared with a community of friends and other players worldwide. Finally, the main challenge will be answering questions against the “Boss” to save the princess. Characters can be chosen and customised at the beginning of the game.In the powerpoint you can see, how the game could look like.

At the same time, some of the products that we usually buy have a large addition to the original price. Therefore the idea of this application came as a solution!SaveIt analyses last purchases of a customer and based on that information it provides a cheaper market alternative for each product that did not have the most advantageous price. Our application compares prices for the same product from different online resources, it offers statistics of the money that could have been saved by buying products from a different store.First of all, our website and static files have been running on a node.js server and have been built in HTML, CSS and angular.js.
Secondly, the database was created using PostgreSQL, as well as having a restful API built in SpringBoot.
Finally, We have also used price API.The majority of the challenges came from the back-end part, the most relevant one is the asynchronous management of restful API request. It runs as a job so it needs to be queried frequently in order to fetch the response. Furthermore, this has made the front-end templates harder to render giving us no choice other than improvising a caching system focussed around our database.3500 lines of working code.It was a great challenge as it was the first time for us to use SpringBoot. The level of abstractification is really high wich makes it really complicated to debug. A large amount of time was allocated to the implementation of the logger.Several features can be added in the future, they are related to studying the transaction behaviour of the customer in order to offer suggestions for related products regarding their needs.StudentHack VAnca Cristian

We wanted to recreate the experience of having to deal with anxiety and depression by making use of the technology available to us.The interactive experience uses a MySQL database to send heart rate data from an iOS app to a web page using a PHP API. The heart rate is then called from a Unity script which changes the user experience in real-time.We used Unity and C# as a game engine, and connected the PC app to an iOS app that we made. We made use of an algorithm we found online which allows us to measure the user's heart rate in real-time using a technique involving the torch and camera. The heart rate is sent to a MySQL database, and the data is then sent to a web page using our own PHP API. Changes in heart rate are automatically detected by Unity, where a script keeps a constant connection between the interactive experience and the database.Initially, our plan was to use a MUSE headband - which unfortunately was not available to us. We also intended for the experience to be in VR, however we were unable to rent any of the hardware for the project. We adapted our ideas to make them work with the equipment available to us. The most challenging problem that we had was to keep an open connection between the database and Unity, as the script was making a call to the database once each frame (about 60 calls per second). We managed to reduce the number of calls made and to keep the connection open for the duration of the experience.We are very proud of being able to put together a good range of functioning and high-level technology in order to create a smooth synergistic experience. Using the user's heart rate to evaluate how the experience should change was challenging but was extremely rewarding to watch. Seeing a user place their finger on an iPhone camera and watch the experience change accordingly was a good feeling. We're also proud of being able to produce the idea to a degree we are happy with despite not being able to access the technology we initially wanted.We learned how to connect a web page to a Unity script and apply changes in real-time according to the data gathered. And we learned that you can measure your heart rate by scanning your fingertip on your phone's camera! We've learned a lot of valuable things like managing API calls per minute, managing frame-rate in Unity, and manipulating an environment at run-time.Discussing with one of the mentors we decided that there are a few future applications of STORM. One would be to refine the experience in order to assist those suffering from mental health issues express themselves to those who have not. Another possible application would be to expand our database in order to collect information based on age, height and weight with the intention of performing some kind of metadata analysis.StudentHack VI worked on the Unity project, including the scripts, the user interface and the interactions.iOS Heart Rate Monitor App / PHP API + DatabaseAlessia Nigretti

Additionally, we used screen sizes and in total 25 different measurements to generate an identity for each device that logs in the system. This information is then stored in the database. When the user logs in to the system, their email and password is then used to retrieve that identity and compare their current identity to the model we've built up in the past.If the match is below a certain threshold, the user should be asked to answer all the traditional questions or perform 2 -factor authentication.

During the travel, the drone streams video from the front camera and the software on the server uses OpenCV to detect if there are persons present.We used the Parrot AR Drone API to make the drone follow a fixed path and return at the start point. OpenCV was used to detect the presence of people in the video stream.We tried integrating with Twillio to be able to start the surveillance on request by sending a text message and receive status updates as text messages.

Only your melody can get you through your lock screen! Ideally, you could set up any of these passwords for any app, and we would integrate many different types of instruments.We started off with a few core objects and one screen. As the requirements expanded over time we created more screens and fleshed out said objects with concrete code such as creating file IO.We had an idea to get past the lock screen by playing an actual instrument next to your phone. This would've been super secure because you would have needed to go home to play your grand piano! Or you could set up a simpler instrument that you can 'fake' anywhere such as a drum - unlocking it through a series of claps.

By using this API, our program takes messages, posts, and comments online and is able to return a Boolean value based on the different emotional levels of the text - either the post is suitable or it should be blocked. This was achieved by using a Python Flask back-end to carry out this function, and a java-script google chrome extension client-side to allow access in the browser.The primary challenge was accurately identifying the posts that were suitable as opposed to the posts that were classified as harassment and so should be blocked. This was achieved using a comparison of the results given by IBM Watson's Tone analyser, results are given as different levels of emotions in the provided text - for example Fear or Anger. By comparing the positive emotions to the negative ones, we were able to identify which posts were harassment and which were not with a reasonable level of accuracy.In the process we have become experienced with the creation of Google Chrome Extensions as well as the difficulties of identifying negative content online.To futher the harassment blocker project, ideas would include implementation in other browsers, and most importantly, development of our own algorithms to identify harassment rather than reliance on a outside API. This for instance would be extremely interesting to implement using Machine Learning in the future.StudentHack VDavid Chambers

We theorized that if you could find the absolute cheapest flight from any city in the US to any city in Europe, you could connect with budget airlines for cheap.Our website takes as input the user location, final destination, and their travel dates to find the main intercontinental flight. Currently, only North America and the EU are implemented.We wrote a program in Python and used Flask (Python Microframework) to interact with and feed data to the skyscanner API, as well as display the information using an integrated Google Maps API. Built simple website using HTML and CSS. This is how we get our price information and overall display.The greatest challenge was figuring out how to get the API to return the information we wanted and how to give it the information it needed to do that. We also had formatting issues with the website we built for the project.We are most proud of creating the Python algorithm that drives this program. No other service does exactly what we do and we're excited to have done something new.We learned how to interface the API for the least amount of data possible and parse it for the desired results. Also learned better uses for Python, like how tuples worked, and how to interface skyscanner API.We hope to implement connecting flights within continents to give users the absolute cheapest price.

We really thought we could learn a lot from completing this project.There is a webcam live feed that takes a snapshot when the door bell rings. It detects the face of person or multiple persons with the click of a button, and sends the detected image to the ""owner"" via email.We started with a raw javascript webcam script that accessed the video tag of HTML5. In order to capture stills we had to change focus to angularJS to create our own webcam tag. In order to get around security problems of writing to disc
this webcam module must be hosted on a HTTP Server, we will be using python SimpleHTTPServer. Upon capturing a still, the image is sent to our own python server that we coded to accept a base64 string representation of an image. This is the medium through which we needed to send our image. Our server decodes the image and writes to disc. Our next python script takes said image from file store and uses the openCV API to detect any faces. If multiple faces are detected a separate image file is created for each. Finally we have a script that sends the cropped image to a user(person whose door this is) via email.Never used angularJS and the openCV before so the syntax was challenging to get our heads around at first. We also learned a lot about VirtualBox settings as that presented enough of a challenge on its own!It works! Just to leave the weekend with a working product is awesome.Using APIs. Introduction to writing our own server. Manipulating mail clients. Time management.Implementing face recognition so  that the doorbell recognises friends and relatives and can report who they are.

You are given 5 things to take pictures of, within one minute. The first one to get them all wins!The front end is an Android app. It communicates via socket.io to a node.js server that keeps track of the session and sync. The images are recognised using Google Cloud Vision API's.Integrating the API with the Android was a challenge. We tried multiple APIs, settling with Google's for precision and generous trial plan. Multithreading caused some weird issues.
Addressing heavily nested objects took several attempts in node.js.Having no experience with node.js and socket.io we were surprised what we managed to achieve.
We were surprised to obtain a rather polished app after going through various designs.Node.js and socket.io
Image recognition API's behave weirdly quite often. (e.g. sometimes pens are recognised as shotguns)The server now runs locally but we are planning to have it available on the cloud with multi-server support.

Sometimes, all you want is somebody to hang out with for lunch, for a beer, for a movie, maybe for the length of a flight. You're not alone in the struggle. Many other people may be looking for the very same thing. How about we bring two lonely kids together for coffee and conversation?
AskOut aims to do just that: facilitate contact and the inner courage in everybody to ask out a complete stranger.AskOut is a web-app, pinpointing all users in close proximity to each other and allowing them to talk to each other and organise a meet-up. It displays interests and topics of discussion, so that, if small talk fails, you can always bring out the big questions and see yourself fall into an enthralling conversation on politics, religion and whether or not Mary Poppins is a trickster God.
You have to register an account and enter short edgy bits of information about yourself, that could start a conversation and keep it going. You can login, logout, update your information.
Check it out HERE: 80a3e5ca.ngrok.io (Temporary Link)The design is meant to be minimalist and easy to navigate, as well as robust across platforms and browser sizes. All forms works and are meant to improve the user experience. A mixture of Web-design and PHP was required for the final result.Initial plan included Cordova and Twilio integration, but it proved impossible to implement on time.A beautiful website and having pushed my team in a direction with a lot of potential. The PHP Nikita wrote is quite impressive and I was thrilled to have worked with him and Ilias on this idea.Teamwork, team management, advanced CSS and forms.Improved PHP, ability to add personal pictures, Twilio implementation for chats, turning everything into an app, perhaps even pushing it on Google App Store.StudentHack VI came up with the idea, identified works areas, delegated tasks and ultimately was responsible with everything front-end. Ultimately, I tried to turn our website into a mobile app using Cordova, but I didn't have enough time to properly learn how it works.I worked on back end - implemented functionality for chat, getting and setting data, provided Ajax queries to access and modify data in database on the server, implemented getter for current location of user. Tried adding additional ""user"" chat using twilio api along with Ilias.I made the backbone of the webpage implementing HTML code to make the work easier for Ruxandra since she is a designer and has more experience: I am only the implementer.After that, I worked with Twilio API and tried to implement the feature when if someone checks in near as well, all others will receive SMS notification. Unfortunately, it couldn't work, so I united with Nikita to implement online chat.Ruxandra Maria Mindru

If you are a user of our app you are given a number of suggested routes in a menu and you pick one.

The later was implemented through the Twilio API.We have used a piece of open source code from Krishnaraj Varma (https://github.com/krvarma/Amazon-Echo-and-Twilio) that allowed us to send text messages via Alexa which we have then altered to allows us to start the game on the phone by sending a text message to the target client. We have extended the code further to implement the interactive version of the game so you Alexa can ask you questions and you can respond.Being new to Alexa and especially JavaScript it was difficult at first to make sense of the code and understand it well enough so we can model it to our advantage. Also debugging on AWS was a bit of a pain.We are definitely proud of what we managed to achieve in such a short timeframe given the fact that none of us had done this before.I would say we all learned a great deal not only about JavaScript, Python and how they use libraries to implement awesome functionalities but also about development on AWS.Enigma 2.0 should find better strategies of implementing the question/answer part using maybe a decision tree structure , maybe make it work for many clients and add many different questions about different locations around the world while still keeping the informative aspect.StudentHack VI worked on the game's Q&A system.

70,StudentHack V,70,,70,"An endless runner that uses a LEAP Motion to allow you to move obstacles out of the way.the Main Menuthe beginning of the run. Surprises lie ahead.We wanted to embrace the theme of travelling by making a game in which you would be running to catch your plane, dodging usual airport items and people on your way. Due to the extreme lack of  free 3D assets and our lack of expertise with making them, we eventually restricted it to the theme of space, which did open our game to new physics and possibilities.This is a really fun game in which you use your hands, free of any controller, to move obstacles out of your path to the finish line using a LEAP Motion.We used Unity as the main development tool. The LEAP Motion SDK allowed us to implement a pair of virtual hands that would mimic your real hands in the game, using the sensor. Then we made a playing field that would spawn obstacles in waves of increasing speed and complexity, which moves relative to the player, giving the illusion of infinite motion.The main issue was the fact that none of us had used Unity before. The similarities between Java and the C# Unity uses thankfully helped us.
The second biggest issue was the act that the newest version of Unity, which we were using, has changed incredibly much of the inheritance relations between components, methods used by objects and the way you interact with them. This made many of the online resources obsolete.We have successfully proven our understanding of object oriented programming by successfully going way beyond our comfort zone (plain Java).For us, this was a great learning experiment of how we can write a program that interacts in a true way with the real world.The game can easily be made to fit any theme : the airport, te beach, mountains etc. The only things standing in the way of this are the prices of good assets but mostly lack of Blender skills to make them on our own.StudentHack VI set up the leap motion controller in Unity, created the scrolling environment and wave spawning procedure. I implemented the scoring algorithm and permanent high score storing procedure.Mihnea Savu

By using this API, our program takes messages, posts, and comments online and is able to return a Boolean value based on the different emotional levels of the text - either the post is suitable or it should be blocked. This was achieved by using a Python Flask back-end to carry out this function, and a java-script google chrome extension client-side to allow access in the browser.The primary challenge was accurately identifying the posts that were suitable as opposed to the posts that were classified as harassment and so should be blocked. This was achieved using a comparison of the results given by IBM Watson's Tone analyser, results are given as different levels of emotions in the provided text - for example Fear or Anger. By comparing the positive emotions to the negative ones, we were able to identify which posts were harassment and which were not with a reasonable level of accuracy.In the process we have become experienced with the creation of Google Chrome Extensions as well as the difficulties of identifying negative content online.To futher the harassment blocker project, ideas would include implementation in other browsers, and most importantly, development of our own algorithms to identify harassment rather than reliance on a outside API. This for instance would be extremely interesting to implement using Machine Learning in the future.StudentHack VDavid Chambers

We theorized that if you could find the absolute cheapest flight from any city in the US to any city in Europe, you could connect with budget airlines for cheap.Our website takes as input the user location, final destination, and their travel dates to find the main intercontinental flight. Currently, only North America and the EU are implemented.We wrote a program in Python and used Flask (Python Microframework) to interact with and feed data to the skyscanner API, as well as display the information using an integrated Google Maps API. Built simple website using HTML and CSS. This is how we get our price information and overall display.The greatest challenge was figuring out how to get the API to return the information we wanted and how to give it the information it needed to do that. We also had formatting issues with the website we built for the project.We are most proud of creating the Python algorithm that drives this program. No other service does exactly what we do and we're excited to have done something new.We learned how to interface the API for the least amount of data possible and parse it for the desired results. Also learned better uses for Python, like how tuples worked, and how to interface skyscanner API.We hope to implement connecting flights within continents to give users the absolute cheapest price.

We really thought we could learn a lot from completing this project.There is a webcam live feed that takes a snapshot when the door bell rings. It detects the face of person or multiple persons with the click of a button, and sends the detected image to the ""owner"" via email.We started with a raw javascript webcam script that accessed the video tag of HTML5. In order to capture stills we had to change focus to angularJS to create our own webcam tag. In order to get around security problems of writing to disc
this webcam module must be hosted on a HTTP Server, we will be using python SimpleHTTPServer. Upon capturing a still, the image is sent to our own python server that we coded to accept a base64 string representation of an image. This is the medium through which we needed to send our image. Our server decodes the image and writes to disc. Our next python script takes said image from file store and uses the openCV API to detect any faces. If multiple faces are detected a separate image file is created for each. Finally we have a script that sends the cropped image to a user(person whose door this is) via email.Never used angularJS and the openCV before so the syntax was challenging to get our heads around at first. We also learned a lot about VirtualBox settings as that presented enough of a challenge on its own!It works! Just to leave the weekend with a working product is awesome.Using APIs. Introduction to writing our own server. Manipulating mail clients. Time management.Implementing face recognition so  that the doorbell recognises friends and relatives and can report who they are.

The images are recognised using Google Cloud Vision API's.Integrating the API with the Android was a challenge. We tried multiple APIs, settling with Google's for precision and generous trial plan. Multithreading caused some weird issues.
Addressing heavily nested objects took several attempts in node.js.Having no experience with node.js and socket.io we were surprised what we managed to achieve.
We were surprised to obtain a rather polished app after going through various designs.Node.js and socket.io

Sometimes, all you want is somebody to hang out with for lunch, for a beer, for a movie, maybe for the length of a flight. You're not alone in the struggle. Many other people may be looking for the very same thing. How about we bring two lonely kids together for coffee and conversation?
AskOut aims to do just that: facilitate contact and the inner courage in everybody to ask out a complete stranger.AskOut is a web-app, pinpointing all users in close proximity to each other and allowing them to talk to each other and organise a meet-up. It displays interests and topics of discussion, so that, if small talk fails, you can always bring out the big questions and see yourself fall into an enthralling conversation on politics, religion and whether or not Mary Poppins is a trickster God.
You have to register an account and enter short edgy bits of information about yourself, that could start a conversation and keep it going. You can login, logout, update your information.
Check it out HERE: 80a3e5ca.ngrok.io (Temporary Link)The design is meant to be minimalist and easy to navigate, as well as robust across platforms and browser sizes. All forms works and are meant to improve the user experience. A mixture of Web-design and PHP was required for the final result.Initial plan included Cordova and Twilio integration, but it proved impossible to implement on time.A beautiful website and having pushed my team in a direction with a lot of potential. The PHP Nikita wrote is quite impressive and I was thrilled to have worked with him and Ilias on this idea.Teamwork, team management, advanced CSS and forms.Improved PHP, ability to add personal pictures, Twilio implementation for chats, turning everything into an app, perhaps even pushing it on Google App Store.StudentHack VI came up with the idea, identified works areas, delegated tasks and ultimately was responsible with everything front-end. Ultimately, I tried to turn our website into a mobile app using Cordova, but I didn't have enough time to properly learn how it works.I worked on back end - implemented functionality for chat, getting and setting data, provided Ajax queries to access and modify data in database on the server, implemented getter for current location of user. Tried adding additional ""user"" chat using twilio api along with Ilias.I made the backbone of the webpage implementing HTML code to make the work easier for Ruxandra since she is a designer and has more experience: I am only the implementer.After that, I worked with Twilio API and tried to implement the feature when if someone checks in near as well, all others will receive SMS notification. Unfortunately, it couldn't work, so I united with Nikita to implement online chat.Ruxandra Maria Mindru

The later was implemented through the Twilio API.We have used a piece of open source code from Krishnaraj Varma (https://github.com/krvarma/Amazon-Echo-and-Twilio) that allowed us to send text messages via Alexa which we have then altered to allows us to start the game on the phone by sending a text message to the target client. We have extended the code further to implement the interactive version of the game so you Alexa can ask you questions and you can respond.Being new to Alexa and especially JavaScript it was difficult at first to make sense of the code and understand it well enough so we can model it to our advantage. Also debugging on AWS was a bit of a pain.We are definitely proud of what we managed to achieve in such a short timeframe given the fact that none of us had done this before.I would say we all learned a great deal not only about JavaScript, Python and how they use libraries to implement awesome functionalities but also about development on AWS.Enigma 2.0 should find better strategies of implementing the question/answer part using maybe a decision tree structure , maybe make it work for many clients and add many different questions about different locations around the world while still keeping the informative aspect.StudentHack VI worked on the game's Q&A system.

We then used various APIs from Network Rail to get the full schedule information for the various trains so we could track them on their whole journey.The visualisation was built using Three.JS to build a 3D world with stations and trains. The train postion is updated as they progress on their journey.The whole project is then hosted on an AWS Lightsail VPS.We ran into many challenges in this project. First, it took a long time to decide how we would tackle the problem and the best techniques. We struggled to find the APIs we needed, since the Network Rail ones required manual account activation.Our first attempt at the server side code was in Node.JS, which we soon found to be quite difficult to get working. After a few hours, we decided to abandon Node and switch to using Ruby with the Sinatra library.Once our network rail account was approved (at 9PM!), we could get the data from them we needed. However, it turned out this was only available as a 2.5GB JSON file! Turning this into a database we could use took over an hour for it to import!BullHacksStephen Foulds

It's a messMatt bought a linear motorised potentiometer - basically a slider like what you find on a sound mixing desk. The position can be moved by a motor, and it can sense when you're touching it.We thought it would be a great idea to make a game (or set of games) using this as a controller, along with another potentiometer.You can use the pot to control the position of the putter in a golf game. When you putt, the potentiometer slides to one end, as if it was hitting the ball.The voltage of the pots is measured by an arduino, as well as whether or not the linear pot is being touched. These values are then sent via serial to the Raspberry Pi which is running the game. It works out what these values should correspond to in the game.We first tried using H-bridges with an arduino to control the position of the linear pot, but ended up wiring it up wrong, and fried 2 of the things. Then we tried to use a RPi HAT with an arduino, which (surprise, surprise) didn't work. Eventually we had to settle with using the RPi, which was way more effort.Everything pretty much works, and we all learned something new about python and hardware.How to control a linear motorised potentiometer (I love saying that).We have a lot of room to expand, especially through making more games.

While doing coursework, I noticed that my file system could be abit more organised. Thats when my friend and I thought about using AI to organise our systems so we don't have to. That's where Sort.AI comes, inspired from the winner of BrumHack 5.0 who used the Google Natural Language API.Sort.AI is told where your 'Sort Bin' is and opens each text document and places it into the correct location. For example a document about Dogs would go into the Animals folder.Using our experience with C# and knowledge within the Google Cloud API, we worked within the Visual Studio 2017 IDE to create both the form interface and the Windows Service. Unfortunately due to many things out of our hands we were unable to complete the Windows service. However, parts of the implementation have been included already, for example, the notification tray icon appearing and the ability to minimize to tray. We also used the Google Cloud API libraries to create our code.Everything! Literally everything, whether it was the API not connecting or the Windows service not running we came across many challenges while creating Sort.AI. Each of us had some form of battle whether it was against Visual Studio, GitHub or even the Google API. We collectively made decisions on how to tackle these issues including at times even swapping jobs around.Being able to understand the Google API a bit better and design methods where we can utilise the API for the general market.If in doubt, Google's about!We will possibly begin to develop on the idea after BullHacks however due to other commitments and projects this may be unlikely but we might regroup and focus on working on this product in the near future.BullHacksAlexander Davis

We wanted a game about wall banging and haven't used 3D modelling, as such we built it top down and changed some mechanics to work as with it.Spawns 4 players into a small arena. Each player has controls on the same keyboard for movement and firing. This causes it to feel really interactive/cosy. They can shoot walls to make them their colour, if a wall is already your colour you can shoot through it. The aim is to make everyone your colour by shooting them.We implemented a grid system that contains information about a board. Then every time the game goes through the main loop it checks if anyone is trying to move, if they are it moves them as appropriate. If a player presses fire then they shoot a ""laser"" from themselves in the direction they are moving. Firing only occurs if the player is moving to force fast paced play.For some reason certain keys were a little buggy while acting as the fire key but we mostly sorted it. 
Neither of us had ever used swing or other graphics systems for this sort of project and thus made that a bit annoying.Dat interface doe but mainly a function game even if it isn't the prettiest.Implementation of a game style project in swing.BANGER 2: Now with new dimensions
(A 3D version)StacsHack IIII worked on design and initial development alongside Steven, then wrote code to allow the players to move and shoot correctly, as well as displaying the lasers and checking what was hit by them.Steven McWilliam

Would it not be better if somebody else wrote them for me?? This is where Diane comes into play. This Amazon Alexa-inspired helper with a voice interface is qualified coder that will save you the effort of writing endless ""print hello worlds"" and create an ideal environment for your creativity.Listens patiently for you to give it pseudo-code to translate into a programming language (Java, C and Python supported so far), as well as acting as a vocal command line interface to save you typing all those ""cd""'s and ""mkdir""s.Diane is a parser that uses the sphinx4 Java library to parse voice input from either a microphone or a wav file into pseudo code or bash commands, which then get executed.To reliably recognise human speech, sphinx4 has to be trained on a specific human's voice, which requires a large dataset of recordings and a knowledge of machine learning. We avoided that problem by narrowing down the dictionary to the bare minimum needed, which, as we found out, makes the speech recognition more reliable.
We have also had to dance around homonyms such as ""four"" and ""for"" and ""two"" and ""to"". Eventually Diane should be smart enough to deal with ambiguity from context, but that is beyond the scope of a 24-hour hackathon.We have familiarised ourselves with a speech recognition library and strengthened our knowledge in parsing.Speech recognition is a fiddly tool and natural language parsing is much harder than it seems!Support for more expressions, commands and languages, as well as better AI and the ability to deal with ambiguity.StacsHack IIICommandsVictor Vasilyev

This makes finding example code online quite difficult. The API authorisation was also a major problem.We managed to make the alexa work with instagram and had working code for posting comments that unfortunately did not fully translate through the alexa skill. We also have the twitter API working outside of the lambda function but again could not fully bring everything together.We learned a lot about node and skills.

The main feature is the big data analysis based on over sixty thousand 'hacks' all hosted on Devpost.We built a web scrapper that scrapes all hacks from Devpost and later on parses all that data in an incredible small JSON, this JSON is imported in a mongo database, where we use aggregations and various methods of data analysis to find out correlations between various data. This Json is also fed into a Tensorflow model built by us Using a triple input with 5 biases to calculate what we call a DeepHack score, this score is supposed to approximate the amount of prizes one hack will win at a hackathon. At the current state we have around 75% accuracy on our predictions. However we believe we could easily increase this value to over 84% without a lot of work. However working with big data requires incredible amounts of time.The hackathon went fairly easily. However we faced many big data problems along the way, waiting for over an hour for scrappers and parsers to run and even reaching a peak of over 80GB or RAM in use by a single process in our processing server.Coventry University Computer Club HackathonPedro Mendonca

After some research we realised how a good idea this is and challanged ourself with completing a game on the current viral theme Donald Trump.Is a sidescroller game, here the character (Trump) runns and collects tupee's in order to get luscious locksIn few word:We have managed to create a complete game, ready to play, share and sell.Team work is the most important thing in a hackathon.We proposed ourself to do releases at least once a week for the following two months to take advantage of the viral moment of the theme.Coventry University Computer Club HackathonI worked on The API for the leatherboard, SQL server, some art-work, Domains managemant and Team management.The lead 2D Artists and Character Animator as well as the Art Director for the vision of our project.I worked for the leaderboard. The connection and the link to the database and the server and the script that fetches the data into unity. And other based unity scripts like scenes, managers, connection and the buttons as well as UII was the lead 2d artist for the game and key innovator,  making creative decisions through out the entirety of the project. I made the background art and main menu.Created store UI and backend, Google AdMobs integration, In-app purchases.I developed the front end of the game itself. This included the scripting behind the character controller and its visual upgrades, the background and obstacle creation as well as the programming behind the health and animation.ogrezear

By asking this question, we know how people feel. However, how do we know how people felt in the past from what they have produced in the past including their photos, tweets, Facebook posts, etc. We came up with the idea to dig up the past sentiments from the most recently developed technology, and from there, we can know people's past with a single glance of the result.It reads people's tweet and photos to analyse people's emotion in their timelineThe Project is written in python with the help of Microsoft Computer Vision API to analyse faces in the photo, meanwhile, our self-developed text analyse algorithm helps us to extract emotions from lines of text.

We've used services like ""Gify"" which helpfully allow searching of a large index of GIFs but find that often the GIFs we want do not exist.Our hack allows users to split their movies into frames, index captions and use these elements to generate niche GIFs on the fly. The aim was to be able to search such obscure phrases as ""I have the high ground"" and acquire exactly the GIF we have envisioned.Along the way we integrated the ability to create and caption GIFs from a webcam very quickly.We split several films into their frames using ffmpeg and saved them in such a structure that would allow a selection of them to be easily accessed.To build and search our caption index, we used nodejs to write a simple script which interprets .srt subtitle files and indexes them using elastic search. Each subtitle file has its entries indexed alongside their timestamps which is used to determine which frames from the movie are associated with the line being said.The caption and associated frames is sent to the browser where we use gifshot to generate the GIF from the frames and overlay the caption (webcam GIFs are also generated client-side, similarly to this)There are a lot of parts to this hack. We split our tasks between three people and then needed to stitch everything together quite close to the end.A lawsuit (also it would be really nice to index youtube videos and make the virtual machine much easier to use so that anybody can build their own GIF index)WarwickHACK 2017I created the front-end web interface of the project, and hooked up the back-end inputs through JavaScript to enable them to be displayed on the front-end. I created JavaScript functions that broke down the captions and images I got from our back-end server via GET request, and passed them into a GIF making JavaScript library that converted them into a GIF format, alongside the caption of the GIF. This was then passed and displayed on the front-end webpage interface. I also used a similar system to convert a webcam feed with a live preview window on the page into a GIF format with a user-input caption.Callum Kendrick

So I decided to build a mobile application for people with this kind of desease (Alzheimer), who cannot remember associations of faces with names.The mobile application allows the user to develop their own face database, by being able to take a picture of a humans face, associate a name to it and save it to the database. Then they are able to recognize a face, by taking a picture of the desired person and get the name of the person returned.I build it using Swift, Apple's lates programming language.Using the Microsoft Face API with Swift was quite challenging, since there is no tutorial in Swift, just in Objective-C.I am happy that I have a working MVP and it can MOST OF THE TIME recognize faces correctly.I learned a little bit about face recognition methods and how to use the Face API.The next thing that I would do is to create my own face recognition API, because I found that the Face API is not always really accurate. And after that I would start optimizing the mobile app and add different features to it, like user browser or speech recognition for name input for images.WarwickHACK 2017Csongor Barabasi

Save a photo of yourself and reconstruct your face out of other people's!Here is an example of our program making Leo beautiful!Here is an example of our program making Christian (from WarwickTech) beautiful!Our very first 'improved' face!Here is an example of our program making Ben beautiful!We wanted to make something fun and gimmick-y (as this is all of our first hackathon's), and thought what better than something that makes you look so wonderful!
As a gimmick, we decided to combat cyber-bullying in the most ridiculous way possible - if you take a photo of yourself, use our program to exchange parts of your face with other people's, then if somebody were to insult your picture - technically they're not insulting a picture of you! Instead they are insulting a collage of pictures of other people!It takes a 500x500 image (preferably of somebodies face!), and divides it into an n x n grid. It then swaps out each division of the grid to the 'most appropriate' face we could find! The 'most appropriate' part is decided by an algorithm we wrote in our program!We wrote it entirely on Java, throwing around several ideas and implementing them (such as being able to change how many 'divisions' in the image there are). We made sure to structure out program well throughout the event, documenting the files (albeit minimalistically), so that modification of the code was much easier (especially in the morning!).Algorithmically, there were a few initial bugs in the program, which weren't originally obvious. However, we managed to spot all of them and now have a working Java program!
We wanted to develop this as an android application, however none of us have ever had any experience in this field.. we just about added a button to an app before we had to submit our projects!It compiled the first time we wrote it, somewhat amazingly! However, as complete novices with only 1 of us being confident in java (and none of us studying computer science), I think we are more amazed at the fact we got anything at all!We developed our skills in Java, attended all 3 workshops in the afternoon (which were very helpful!), and we introduced ourselves to Android Studio. We also learnt to work together as a coherent team, and really enjoyed doing so!As it’s entirely written in java, we could probably make an android app out of it! 
We could also seek to further improve the algorithm which finds the ‘most appropriate’ substitute for your face, and then swaps them out.
We could also add some facial recognition API, which detects faces, and automatically swaps them out for their new 'improved' face!WarwickHACK 2017Mathematic and Statistics student at University of Warwick, programming, ideas.Project management, idea generation, market research, development research, pitchBen Chiverton

Using client-sided javascript the user does not see the server working but gives him the experience of a native app.We used php 7 for everything server related and jquery for client-sided stuff.Getting the layout to work was sometimes tricky.

While thinking about it I stumbled upon IBM's API that allows to gauge what kind of emotions are present in text. So I came up with an idea to merge both of these. My program parses Reddit's comments and then allows you to search for some topic and shows how often it was mentioned. It could help to determine that something is currently trending or being discussed particularly much and help to correlate event with that. Another feature is tone analysis. I used ToneAnalyzer API from IBM's Bluemix. The emotions shown are averaged over interval to show how they change. Sadly, free account only allowed me to make 1000 requests, so the only topic for which I could analyse emotions was Trump.It was quite an interesting project as I had no experience with either of these APIs and this was my first time coding with Python, which made up most of the project.At first I tried to figure out how PRAW API for retrieving content from Reddit worked. After that I needed to tie it with ToneAnalyzer. Lastly, I used PHP and Google Graph API to create interactive graphs.WarwickHACK 2017Medardas Zobarskas

Insuring against low and high temperatures?WarwickHACK 2017Designed front end, worked with Node.js, Meteor.js and the Web3 library to call solidity methods in the  contract on the ethereum network.I worked on the backed, designing, writing and testing the solidity contract to make sure it was secure but still managed to function well. I also aided with front end, hooking up web3 to communicate with the ethereum network and our smart contract.PK398

What if air was your medium? How about working with others? We explored the possibilities of working collaboratively, without physical touch.AirDraw allows for wireless drawing on a collaborative whiteboard, by moving your fingers through the air to mimic the movements of a pen. Users can simultaneously draw and observe, with the ""air pen"", or opting for the traditional mouse movements.AirDraw provides ""air-pressure"" sensitivity, where moving closer forces the pen to draw on the collaborative inkboard, and moving back simply shows the cursor. There are also gestures available for convenience, such as swiping to rub the board. You're finally able to save the canvas as a PNG image.Sockets.io was used to transmit data between all the collaborating clients. Native HTML5 canvas drawing techniques were used to draw onto the boards. Finally, the Leap Motion device was used to detect air gestures and air pen movements.WarwickHACK 2017Worked on all parts of the application. Focused mainly on the Leap Motion integration.I worked a little on designing the webpage using css.

Available on Facebook Messenger and Skype.It works on SkypeIt works on MessengerThe need for a faster and more comfortable way to obtain information about student loans. We wanted to make it as easy to access and use as possible. That's why we chose to have our chat bot on Facebook Messenger, eliminating the need to install a separate app. It also works on Skype, just to be sure it is as easy to reach as possible!
   We also started working on a website to handle queries using voice recognition. Right now it recognizes voice and outputs it to text. This can now be passed to our bot to handle the rest.We have trained the bot to answer a number of questions about student loans. Application process, tuition fees, how you will repay the loan etc. Apart from that,  If you still have questions, after asking you where you're from, it can put you in touch with a student from your country who has experience with student loans so he can give you some tips.We used node.js for our scripts. We created a bot using the Microsoft bot framework. Then, using the messenger platform for developers, we connected it to our Facebook page. Now the input from the user would be passed by the bot framework to our server, hosted using ngrok. The input was passed to our RECAST.AI bot, which we trained to recognize multiple intents. We made it recognize the key words, as well as more natural language (e.g ""uni"" or ""postgrad""). This would provide another layer of comfort for the user. After the input is interpreted, the appropriate answer is sent to the user.None of us had done anything like this before. We had no idea how any of the services we used worked, or even what the syntax of node.js was.We made a bot! It talked back, it answered our questions! We managed to understand new technology quickly, and most importantly understand what else we need to learn in order to make better bots.Apart from the languages and individual services we used for the first time, we managed to learn how to use them all at once. We learned that connecting services to a script and one another is not as tough as it looks.The bot's intents are implemented in separate files. This means new things can be added quickly, and parts can be updated. In the future, we could make the bot understand language even better, add new things it can answer or connect it to a database of information regarding your personal student loan. The data provided by Recast.ai also has many other components, like sentiment analysis, which could be used.StrathHack17I set up the Microsoft bot framework, the Messenger platform and the Recast.ai bot. I wrote the .js scripts that provide answers based on data interpreted by Recast.I worked on the Android app, the website and the design implementation of the speech recognition API.I built a voice recognition module over Annyang API which I later on incorporated in the website of our app. I helped my teammates with Recast.ai bot, wrote some pieces of it (in .js) and I also did some configurations on the Microsoft's backend for the chat bot.Mihnea Savu

We decided to help Student Loan Company ride the wave of the oncoming conversational chat interface wave.Loanly is a collection of services which allows any student to access information using natural language, either on the Amazon Echo or through an automated text bot that understands natural language over text.We used Python to scrape data from the Student Loan Company website, which was then fed into a noSQL database. We also set up a mock database that mimics user info. That way, users can access information about their loan themselves. This noSQL interface was queried using Javascript libraries by the Alexa and Twilio bot to provide structured responses towards user queries.Getting Alexa to understand accents was difficult. It took us some time to fix this problem. Scraping data from the Student Loan Website was difficult due to bad html and lack of consistent structure. Moreover, translating it into structured data that can be easily queried was tricky too.We got all of our features done in time.We learnt a lot of additional Alexa functionality.

Although I question the legitimacy of this claim, I am convinced that censorship is not the way to defeat online and offline harassment.The Android keyboard (soft input device) that we developed is based off an older version of the vanilla keyboard. It reads and temporarily stores a buffer of the last 30 characters typed with it, and analyzes it against a dictionary of words that might be used to harass someone. The list, for the purpose of this project, has been kept as family friendly as possible, and is more of a demonstration of the potential capabilities of software like this. The software briefly interrupts with a message to the one typing, when it deems that potential harassment may occur as result of the message.We built the application by using an older version of the vanilla Android soft input device, that is available on the Google Git. We did an override of the method calls that it makes to the system, and added our own code into it. We used Android Studio for that purpose.Understanding how the original keyboard worked was the main challenge for our group. None of us are active android developers, but we think that it is worth it to convey our idea in some way.Managing to make the user typing think twice about what they are sending without censoring their text, and without being too disruptive to the typing process itself.We learned a lot about the android services and activities lifecycles, and how an android application works internally in general.We would love to see opportunities to develop this idea into a finished product, with proper natural language recognition algorithms, that would void the need to use phrase dictionaries.StirHackI worked on conceiving the idea, and most of the code written by ourselves in the project.Boyan Atanasov

We really enjoy coding diferent algorithms and resource-intensive programms.
We recently started reading about neural networks, and decided to do something useful with them.
The SignatureAuthentifier is a programm that uses neural networks and a set of signatures to learn how to identify a given signature while not being fooled by forges. While showing a small version of it, a complete programm would be extremely useful in any area where strong security is required.
We build it with a combination of Python to code images and C++ to do the computing bulk.
The biggest challenge was working with a  neural network, since we had never worked with one before. We used a third-party programm as the base, and then built on it to make it specific to solve our situation. Getting the data was sometimes hard, since changes in the light would trigger unintended responses. 
As a team, we are really proud of what we have done. We have learnt how to work with neural networks from scratch, and been able to make a strongly efficient code, both in time and the size of the data set required. We feel like we really did what we wanted to do in a stylish way.
We have learnt how to choose a proper topology, how to spot errors in data sets that make the neuronal network contaminated, and A LOT about how neuronal networks work.
The next step would be making an embeded version for things like phones, safes and similars, the gadgets where it would really shine.StirHackrabbitwhile

We solved this problem by exposing the glove to other apps on the phone as an API and building some sample apps ourselves.The glove has buttons on three of the fingers, that the user can press to control various things on their phone. Currently our sample apps are a trumpet synthesiser and a test scrolling application.The buttons are registered on inputs to the Micro:bit, that then exposes them in a BLE service to any phone that wants to connect to it. We have a base app that runs a service to talk to this Micro:bit and listen for these presses. This service then broadcasts these presses as events in the phone that can be subscribed to by any other app.Bluetooth is really hard and neither of us had worked with GATT before. This caused a lot of problems. We also weren't able to solder due to health and safety constraints, so we had to wire together the glove using pliers, scissors, cardboard and lots of tape.We have an API, so the next step will be documenting it and releasing it to the world, perhaps in the form of build instructions.StirHackI built the micro:bit software and the Android BLE component. The micro:bit just exposes a GATT service that allows the phone to read each of the input pins, and the phone scans for this service and connects to it.I worked on the android end producing 3 seperate apps as well as on the coonstruction of the glove. Firstly the main app running as a service in the background, trasmitting the bluetooth data recieved from the microbit. Secondly the trumpet app producing a real time MIDI files for synthesis. Thirdly a simple recieving Scroll app to test the scrolling functionality of yellow.Cameron MacLeod

Using the general time of those tweets, it would then find the change in stock market price for the company after a short delay to allow for those changes, and note whether the stock increased or decreased. This data was then fed into a machine-learning algorithm in order to predict whether a stock would rise or fall, given a general sentiment from tweets.I built it using a variety of APIs, notably:The Yahoo-Finance API only allowed for checking on a daily level when looking at historic data, meaning I could not achieve the granularity I would have required while at the hack. It should be feasible to record tweets now and see the impact later on in the day to provide training data, but this was not practical to do at the hack due to time-constraints.More-or-less implementing a system to predict a rise or fall in company stock.

The state imposes on its citizens restrictions as tight as birth control with no choice, pre-selected career paths for certain specially bred individuals and a casted hierarchical system that cannot be broken.

Fluids are some of the hardest physics objects to implement in game development, and we soon realised it would not have been possible for us to implement them on time. So we decided to brainstorm for alternatives and we came up with the idea of exploiting the 2D part of our game to use a 2D sprite that gives the illusion of being a 3D mesh.We are proud of managing to reach the main targets we had for our hack, since we thought we were being really ambitious!

The first: you make a trip to the stores, buy everything your eye lands on, and end up throwing out half of it by the end of the week.
The second: you take a break from your laptop at 10 PM, you're starving, but you find nothing in the fridge.
We thought it was time to put an end to this.MegaBite is an intelligent food planner. You can choose what you'll eat in the following week from a list of delicious recipes. Our app will work its magic to tell you how much of each ingredient to buy. Then, when 10 PM comes rolling around, you can ask your Amazon Echo to speak out the recipe.Starting from a Material Design CSS template, we designed a responsive web application with a PHP backend. Behind the scenes, we keep track of user accounts and store food plans in an SQL database. We process this information on the fly with PHP to calculate recipes and shopping lists.We also integrate with Amazon's Alexa Skills API, which required two parts. On Amazon's developer console, we defined the interaction model and recognised phrases for the skill. Secondly, our server listens for HTTP requests from Alexa, processes the information, and returns a JSON-formatted response.Having only begun working on the project during the Hackathon, it was a challenge to handle the tricky and poorly documented Alexa APIs, in a short amount of time. It was also incredibly difficult to debug the PHP behind Alexa, as Amazon's error message gave us no insight into the problems.We are very pleased with the fact that our app ""Just Works"". With a fully functional user account system, and a flawless integration with Alexa, MegaBite is more than a minimum viable product.Working with voice interaction was an interesting experience. We learned how to deal with the ambiguities of the English language when defining the Echo's interaction model. On the other end of the line, we also had to write our responses in ways that Alexa could successfully speak out loud.The road ahead for MegaBite is full of possibilities. Food is an enormous part of our daily life, and having an intelligent platform can be of great help. We have many ideas lined up for the future:Soon, we hope to distribute MegaBite for general use.IC Hack 17Lorenzo Silvestri

People can visit the website and view books that have been finished or books that are currently being voted on in an animated book with real pages. You can then go to a voting page and write a suggestion for what you think should be the next sentence. After an allotted time the sentence with the most votes is immortalised in the book, the poll refreshes and you move onto the next sentence.We built the website using mySQL for the database that holds the book and voting information, and php which interacts with this database, sending results to the client which is displays information using a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.We originally set out using node.js and socket.io, but since none of us had experience with socket.io, and the documentation was very poor, we decided to switch to php. Unfortunately this meant our voting system was no longer real-time, but we felt this was justified. We also have little experience with HTML, CSS or JavaScript, so it was challenging to dive into web development looking at code we didn't understand. This meant a lot of our website has some shocking code in it, using some very hacky techniques to bodge a solution (Don't tell anyone).Despite not achieving everything we wanted to, we managed to create a fully working solution from front to back end. We are quite impressed with the results, especially considering much of the technical skills we used were completely new and alien to us.We learnt A LOT. Despite the obvious answers of the programming languages themselves we learnt how to use GitHub to streamline our workflow, and split the workload across the group so we all get some experience on front and back end development.Who knows!

Waste sorting has been around for decades but people still tend to throw stuff to general waste bin even when it should go in recycling. We wanted to build an IoT solution to the problem, which will help recycling by automatically telling the user where the thing he is holding goes.Mr. Bin saves the planet. When approaching Mr Bin with litter the camera will detect the object with a certain accuracy, then it will classify it as recyclable, general waste or non-recyclable. It will finally point to one of the bins below the screen for the user to throw your waste in.We built Mr Bin with Python and Microsoft Computer Vision APIs deep learning algorithms. We also used OpenCV and multithreading to capture the live stream video. After the program recognizes a frame, we used the image tags and confidence levels to go through a data base of possible waste items and then sorted them accordingly. We have also used Microsoft's TextToSpeech API to have Mr Bin saying the destination bin out loud. Finally we wrote a welcoming GUI using tkinter.At first we had to familiarise with the APIs, but the hardest part was allowing live stream video capture. We achieved this by capturing the video and sending every 10th frame to a seprate thread that will analyse it and display the result, while the main thread keeps capturing and dispatching.We had never worked with computer vision before and trying to understand so working with it raised a few problems.
The hardest task was indeed allowing live stream computer vision since there wasn't an API for it. We managed it by analysing evey 10th frame of the video capture.
We're also very proud of managing to work well in a team that had never work together before.We had to coordinate in order to deal with spaghetti code and finally get the product ready.We have been using computer vision algorithms for the first time. We familiarised with python multithreading and Microsoft's APIs for Congnitive Services and Text-toSpeech.The biggest improvement we want to bring to this IoT solution is some electronic component such that Mr Bin will be a stand alone product which will automatically dispatch the waste in the right bag after detecting it. In this scenario the user just throws waste in the it and the bin will operate automatically by detecting the type of waste and putting it in the right bag using motors and a scale. We believe that this would reduce user effort and improve recyclability like never before.IC Hack 17I worked on backend taking care of API calls and JSON interpretation, as well as producing the final classification outputI worked on the backend, taking care of python multi-threading to make the live video work properly with the use of API calls on frames.Andrea D'Olimpio

Since Snapchat's have their own proprietary platform, now everyone can have their own new fancy QR Codes at their fingertips.The API provides two main functionalities. One, it knows how to generate a unique codification for every client requesting it. Two, it knows how to take unfiltered images, for example like those taken from a real life camera, and extract the information from the image.The API is built on top of the Spring REST Framework. For the iOS app, we used standard libraries in order to showcase the functionality. What's more important is that all the picture processing is done directly on pixels, without using any 3rd party vision libraries.One of the main challenges was to get the geometry and the algorithms behind scanning the image, since real life camera data can be rotated on multiple axis. This part took more than 20 hours to get it right.We are extremely happy to be able to call the whole project a great achievement. We believe that not only is this a great implementation of something that is not open for everyone, but it also changes the future of QR Codes, the way we used to know them.IC Hack 17Calin Farcas

We came to Imperial Hack 2017 with a plan to make a bot that deals with travel plans, but after spending 6 hours on it, it felt quite boring and we brainstormed some ideas.We wanted something fun, interesting, using Messenger and some cool APIs like image recognition, so Snaploop was born. (we didn't know the name until 2 a.m. though)Snaploop is very simple: just send a message to bot, and it randomly selects one of the players that are playing the game to take a photo. The photo gets analysed by our awesome 3rd party AI services, and shows some tags. If user is happy with those tags, they are sent to all other players, which have to snap something that matches the tags.The first user who gets the picture close enough gets to set the new challenge, and it repeats. Infinitely. Looping. Infinite snaps. Snaploop. You get the idea.It was built using the Microsoft bot framework which provides an awesome way to handle actual interaction between the actual bot code and Facebook Messenger platform. node.js was used for all of the code, with image recognition provided by ClarifAI.Main challenge was fine tuning the gameplay flow so it keep being fun, without getting players frustrated. Other than that, there were no significant issues.It is fun, works without any additional apps as 2 billion people already use Messenger, its quite snappy (pun intended) and has a viral potential. It was funny looking at my teammates running around at 2a.m. looking for fire extinguisher. ( lit)We learned that there is such this as too much pizza, that SQL Server is very hard to set up, and that a cool and minimum viable product can be built in a very small team in less than a day.

Yune a friend!As students and workers, we frequently don't have enough time to go out to eat somewhere far especially during the day. At the same time, we don't want to eat alone. So, our group decided to create an app that suggests optimal places to eat within the time limit you have with your friend that is nearby.As mentioned in the inspiration, we created an app that gives suggestions of places to eat to two friends who are willing to meet during their short break. You are allowed to input the time you have into the app, and the app will accordingly let you know which places are safe for you guys to attend and not be late to your next lecture/meeting!We used APIs such as Google Maps and Firebase to provide data for our app. We also simplified the logging in process using the Facebook login API.We got git conflicts in the beginning because we were not familiar with the git pushing/pulling process. Also, gathering the right APIs we need were bit of a challenge because some did not meet our expectations.We're proud that we got to connect all the APIs together and create the desired app.We used how to use APIs, Firebase, and git properly. We also learned that developing an application in 24 hours is a very different task.As of now, the application only works for two people so we could increase the number of users allowed. Also, since we are using Facebook friends as a source of connection, we could add a separate sign up button and possibly a security check so that some friends who you aren't close to don't see you on the map. In addition, transportation could be added such that the time calculated for distance isn't just done for walking. There are many implementations that can be made, and hopefully be used worldwide.IC Hack 17Yoon Kim

What they lack is the interface to provide inspiration, and the ability to quickly explore different places around the world.GlobeScope is a web-app that allows the user to quickly find information about a destination, like flight prices, general description, photos, weather reports and so on. The app returns the data quickly, and the interface is responsive. This allows the user to efficiently explore different areas and find inspiration by hopping from place to place.The web-app is a primarily front end application. The site was built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All the APIs were called using jQuery in JavaScript. We needed a responsive and fluid globe with a map overlay, to do this we used and open source JavaScript library called Cesium, and accessed this with Node.JS.A large problem we had was synchronisation of API functions. In some functions, we needed to pass one or more API calls, into another API call. Simply writing line by line would not have given the AJAX requests enough time to return their responses. To allow time for this, we used a combination of chaining callback functions, and using 'promises' in JavaScript where appropriate. We also had to consider that sometimes, API requests do not come back successful, and we had to be ready to accept failed, or partial responses. The Expedia API, whilst containing very rich data, had a complex data structure which involved retrieving a 'LegID' from one area of the structure, and looking that ID up in another part.Being first years and in our first hackathon, we also found the division of tasks and merging of code an interesting challenge, sometimes we had performed unit testing that had passed, and later found that when the functions were chained together, they often had unexpected edge cases that we had to account for. This required good planning and prior agreements of what data and arguments we would be passing to each other.Only one of the members of our group had ever had experience with front end and web development. Within 2 days, the rest of us had learnt how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript with jQuery and AJAX calls to make and process API requests, and render their results to the webpage. We were proud to produce a finished and smart product that works as designed.We learned about the challenges of delayed responses in AJAX requests, and how to handle them using chained callbacks and JavaScript promises. We also learned how to traverse JSON data structures to build objects and 'craft' the data that we required from them.GlobeScope could make use of far more APIs, in particular (if we were able to become reputable), using the TripAdvisor API, as it is only available to reviewed applicants or their API. This would enable us to not only return reviews of places, but find similar places to the destinations that the user is searching. We could also link the user's profile to Facebook or other social networks, and use big data algorithms to match their attributes to other user's search responses, and even more intelligently suggest places that the user might like to visit.If we had had a little more time, we would have incorporated package holidays from Expedia's API, as well as finding the most popular times of year to visit, to develop infographics of price changes throughout the year.IC Hack 17Rohan Pritchard

There is not a hint of hope in them. We decided to bring a change to headlines you encounter on a daily basis with this Alexa skill called Content.Google defines the word 'Content' as information made available by a website or other electronic medium.
It also defines it as a state of peaceful happiness. Our aim is to bring positive news articles forward and hence the name.Content provides positive headlines in various categories to you. It will also text you the link of the article if you are interested in further reading.We used the Bing Search API for Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services to obtain news headlines in 6 different categories (World News, Politics, Entertainment, Business, Sports and Technology). We then fed each headline into the Google Text Analytics API which assigned a sentiment score from -1 to 1 with -1 being highly negative and 1 being highly positive. When the user ask Alexa if there are any positive headlines in a particular category, a randomly selected rating with a sentiment score of 0.7 or higher will be read out by Alexa and if the user is interested in reading the news article, the user will receive a text from Alexa with the news article's link.The biggest challenge we faced was Google Text Analytics API assigning a positive rating to news headlines a human would consider highly negative. That is why the threshold of 0.7 was selected in order to ensure that highly positive headlines will be read outWe learnt use and deploy Azure and Google Cloud services.

For example, a playlist containing both classical and hip hop music, of which the user enjoys both of, may not flow well in the wrong environment or mood. It may also be displeasing for the user to hear such a wide varation in songs.ContextualShuffle loads the entirety of your music library and learns associations between specific categories of music. Using these categories and other song-specific features such valence, tempo, and genre, similarities are identified between other songs in your library, without any intervention on your part. Similar songs are then queued (shuffled) such that the genre or other features of importance does not vary too much from song to song. 
By monitoring the user's facial expressions, the efficacy of the queuing system is further adapted and improved each iteration.Starting with the initial aim of identifying similar songs, a large music dataset was required. We sought to acquire features and labels that were most relevant for every track in the dataset. We identified the following features as critical in classification of each track:An ensemble of a 1000 decision trees was trained with boosting to extract feature importance, corresponding to the above features. The features were then normalized between -1 and 1 to allow for an easier evaluation. Using the resulting features we calculated, the cross-correlation between different songs was calclated and an incrementally built list of succeedingly similar songs was continually adapted using positive and negative emotions determined by Microsoft's Cognitive API service.Following this, when a user plays a given song from their library, the most similar songs to each corresponding song are played successivelly. This means the first song's nearest neighbour is played. The neighbour then becomes the root from which calculations are considered, and it's nearest neighbour is played and so on. This provides a good balance of variation and consistency between tracks.OpenCV has posed multiple difficulties due to version compatibility and limited support for python 2.7. Even after installing it for  Python3 a large amount of time was needed for everythin to work as intended. 
The Spotify API download rate has posed a significant problem due to the large amount of training data that was required by our algorithms.
The Azure API examples could improve in terms of documentation.
Running Webcams through virtual machines was nearly impossible, so we had to resort to communicating to external mobile devices.
Labelling of genres, and appropriate mining of data was difficult to achieve due to 
Communication between different technologies was difficult and rather consuming.We believe this product is workable, usable, and performs in-line with our initial aims and goals
The large amount of different technologies into the product has given us a brief but enjoyable experience with each of them.
Generating and creating workable training and testing datasets given the large amonut of variables in a given track.Avoid OpenCV if possible.

We show the world as a heat map, using Twitter to analyze current emotions.This is an application, currently for Android, that allows the user to type in a keyword. Upon submission, the user is brought to a map of the world, which is appropriately shaded for each region based on the sentiments of the tweets sent from that area. All tweets are analyzed with a machine learning algorithm that gives the tweets a coefficient of positivity and negativity, which we use to determine the shade of the specific region. Sample tweets hover around the regions, too, giving the user a very immersive and cool experience.The front-end team (Julian Chow, Rishi Rabheru, Ashley See, and James Tavernor) used Java to code the user interface. The back-end team (Anthony Alridge, Nicholas Li, and Shravan Nageswaran) used Python to import and customize a machine learning algorithm to analyze the sentiment of the tweets, retrieve tweets from many regions, and combine these two to create a map that linked coordinates of the world to the appropriate colour of the map representation. Ultimately, we connected these programs well and made the full application.The API would only provide us with 2500 tweets per minute (and we wanted a lot of data). Because of this, we limited the ICHACK version of the app to major cities in the United Kingdom and Ireland, but we look to continue developing the app to make it a worldwide representation.We are very proud of optimizing the machine learning algorithm to process each tweet quickly. Additionally, implementing and manipulating a map in Android is quite challenging, and our front-end team did a phenomenal job of doing that. Plus, all of our code is readable, and the app, itself, is simple for users to pick up and enjoy!We learned that processing data poses its challenges - especially when we want to analyze millions of tweets! Additionally, from ICHACK, we taught ourselves how to combine front-end and back-end work to accomplish the endeavor of a comprehensive application. It was a very enjoyable, hard-working, and rewarding experience.Heatwave is continuing to be improved. Once we can process more data, we will make Heatwave assess all cities around the world. Additionally, we look to continue improving the graphics, adding a blend method that will appropriately blend two colours in adjacent regions to make the entire map look more cohesive. All in all, we wanted to create an app that is unique, insightful, and - quite frankly - fun, and that is what we did! But we are not done yet.IC Hack 17Anthony-Alridge

We lost about 5 hours while the algorithm was creating settings and training, but we managed to catch up after and finalise the project.

Sadly, nothing really. With members of this group struggling to wake up and struggling to sleep, what better way to tackle this issue than stick a circuit in your pillow.A raspberry pi running a server is connected to a pressure sensors sitting below a pillow. A mobile app has been developed that can communicate with this server and more.We split the task evenly and dove head first into the work. Sleep is for the feeble.
We used hardware labs and the laser cutters to design pressure sensors. We had to create and test our bluetooth server on the raspberry pi. We had to try to get a smart phone to talk to server and integrate it into the mobile app. After finalising how the server and client communicate, we tried to build some dynamic applications on top of this.All of the group members had to start from scratch with regards to server setup, bluetooth communications, Android development and hardware based pressure sensors.We initially also planned to integrate this application with Android's base system alarm clock. However this was extremely challenging and API was kind of confusing too. The process itself is pretty simple, as behaviours for sleeping on the pillow has been defined. We were planning to implement some restrictions on a person sleeping on a pillow and turning of an alarm, or a person sleeping on a pillow and snoozing one too many times. Unfortunately time was a massive constraint.Several possible future integration.
Highly reliable hand made sensors.
Real time view of the 8 pressure points in the pillow.We learned how to setup a bluetooth server with sockets and how to connect a phone to it.

However, we thought it would be fun to implement it for tongue twisters. These are phrases usually hard to pronounce to humans, but not to Alexa. We believe this is a fun way for users to learn tongue twisters while hearing them more clearly.Every day, Alexa will have a new tongue twister for you to practice on (chosen from a pre-made database). Not only can you hear Alexa pronounce them properly (also a bit robotically), but you can also practice by readingWe used Javascript to create a lambda function for the Alexa skill. The database of tongue twisters we got it from ""http://www.uebersetzung.at/twister/en.htm"". Using the Alexa API we built the Alexa skill.It took us 8 hours for the server to say ""Hello World"" and a lot longer for the Echo Dot to say it. We had to learn how lambda functions work for the AWS Lambda. Alexa took a while to recognise our commands to the skill.Alexa managed to pronounce the tongue twisters clearly. The whole program runs, despite the little challenges at the beginning.We got to use and experiment with the Echo Dot for the first time. We realised that you should not use reserved or common words for the invocation name for a skill as Alexa will not recognise the skill properly. Most of all, we learned to use the Amazon Web Services, the Alexa API, as well as Javascript.In the future we would like to increase the database for the tongue twisters. This would in turn allow for different levels of difficulty. One even further step would be to implement this feature in other languages too.IC Hack 17Jixi Shan

Now I fully intended to leave early, only drink 2 pints, but somehow, not for lack of trying ended up worse for wear, hanging in a lecture theatre, about to start a 36 hour hackathon (again). I'm not alone in this. It is so easy to fool yourself,  but data doesn't lie, machine learning can be used in an app to tell you whether you should go home.""Should I go home?"" is a humourous web app where people can go on and answer a sequence of 6 tick box questions before being told whether they should a) continue drinking full steam ahead, b)have one more drink, c) go home, what are you even doing out in the first place. The results are calculated using a cognitive service regression algorithm, based off peoples past drinking experiences and how worth it they were.I think it has real application for the student market, excessive alcohol consumption is a problem, but no one wants to be controlled. Most PSAs are unappealing, and struggle to be relateable plus it's really hard to judge your drunkness levels even based on your own past experiences. ""Should I go home?"" removes these issues, giving a reliable, impartial source, informed by your peers past actions and has a fun, simple user interface.The web app was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, handlebars and node. As users would answer 6, multiple choice button questions. Its designed to be quick, simple and humourous to appeal to its target drunk, student audience. Once their 6 responses had been recorded, this data could be sent to the azure api, and in response the app would receive a ""worthit"" score for the person to keep drinking.To start with users are asked what kind of drinker are they: light weight (penguin, cos feathers are light), heavy weight (bears, because bears are bare heavy) and average (""pengbears a cross between the two."")I posted a survey to reddit where I asked people to describe their recent drinking experiences. They answered the same 6 questions as on the website, plus one evaluation question of how worth it the night was (used as the label score), These were used to train the algorithm, the higher the worth it score, the more likely my web app recommended to continue drinking.The node.js was more rudimentary than I would have liked, I could not solve a bug that prevented browsers registering modified XHR, so the url could not be updated on the website. It was very frustrating as it was a matter of configuration of static files rather than something directly related to programming. This prevents multiple users using the website at once, or me exploring session data etc.I managed to quickly get accurate outputs for a trained machine learning algorithm to use in the app, I really enjoyed developing the graphics and my ""pengbear"" is baller.I learned how to develop a node.js application with good structure between dynamic and static content. Also how to call azure apis, and use their cognitive services.In the future I would want to integrate it with the mobile platform, so that accelerometers could detect whether someone was ignoring the apps advice, and based on that decide whether to help the student in the morning with ""how to deal with your hangover"" advice. Also instead of training the API on such a small dataset, users would have the option to input their own experiences to add to the dataset or validate how effective the apps recommendations had been the morning after.
With a larger dataset, the number of possible questions could be far greater, including maths problems to evaluate someones current cognitive skills, and a small subset of these could be chosen, to keep the app interesting.IC Hack 17rebecca simpson

After identifying these words we used the word association API to compose relevant words related to the poems.

Additionally, we were grateful on the great documentation provided by Microsoft that made our life a lot easier using the API's.We would like to create better sentence structure that is more accurate grammatically as well as making the poems more meaningful.

The other three members mainly worked on programming, splitting different language requirements for our game.We found doing the artwork incredibly challenging, as we found that it was more time consuming than we originally thought. Additionally, the difficulty of creating a feasible story line was greater than we thought.We managed to make a game on which we received very positive feedback from various other IC Hackathon participants (we managed to scare them). We believe the original drawings we produced for the game were very successful and fit the horror atmosphere of the game. Sound effects were used incredibly well in combination with our graphical effects.We learned how to keep awake and work efficiently under sleep deprivation. We additionally learned how to work more effectively as a team. Our team got on very well and we are happy to work together again in the future. We learned how to modify audio (e.g. from third party sources), how to use Photoshop to enhance our artwork and in particular we learned how to modify voices of our team members.Although we have plenty of user interaction, we want to further enhance this area, by implementing hand gestures to allow users to interact with the game using the video motion API (Microsoft). If the game is longer, we could store data from the user (given the user's permission of course) into a database and perform data analysis from this. We may continue working on Karma and release it to market.IC Hack 17Kai Du

The idea is simple: You select a subset of users you are interested it in, and if the interest is mutual, you both get notified. Hardened dildo.io is a a paper that describes how to build a similar system, with the additional property that the server can't know who you like and dislike.Our goal for ICHack 17 was to implement the Hardened Dildo.io paper as a web application.HardCrypto is a private and cryptographically secure matchmaking service, aimed at student communities, that can guarantee to keep your likes and preferences private without having to trust the server (and whoever hacks into it).It's like Tinder, but only with verified people from your school, and nobody except for you can know who you like. Or philosophy is one where we put users preference first and assume all options are opt in and that no information (such as sexual orientation) is assumed.The core idea behind HardCrypto is Homomorphic Encryption, a form of encryption that allows computations to be carried out on the ciphertexts without revealing the plaintext. When every user joins, they create an RSA key pair for signing and encrypting messages and publish their public key. Then, for every other user in the system, a Paillier key pair is generated and sent to the other user encrypted with their public RSA key. The server can then perform operations on the numbers encrypted with the Paillier key pair.Our stack is built in EcmaScript 6. We use node.js, express, mongo for the backend and React for the frontend, along with tons of libraries.Launching at Imperial in Spring Term 2017.IC Hack 17Johannes Prosser

Can't be bothered to read them? Say no more.Some of our friends speak too much. Ever woken up in the morning, checked your phone and realised that you have hundreds of unread messages? We can't be bothered to read them - can you?The reason we developed a piece of software for the Amazon Echo was that this can be queried on the go. We don't need to stop and look at a screen to be updated - we can just listen to it whilst doing other things. Time saving is very important in this day and age, and we want to cater to this by allowing users to do tasks in parallel.Our code looks through a specific chat's history and finds the user's last message. From that point on, we assume that the user has not read any messages. From these messages, we select the lines of text for Alexa to say in the order of ""importance"" (this can be changed depending on what the user finds important).We wrote a lambda function instead of using web services to host the server. Customised intents, utterances and implementations of Alexa skills (written in nodejs) were then written using the Amazon Alexa api.Getting Alexa to say ""hello world"" was a challenging task (it took us 8 hours). Part of this required knowledge of writing a lambda function and linking this to Alexa.
Deciding what messages are ""important"" to different people is very hard, and this is a problem that can hopefully be fixed by using ideas similar to using cookies.Considered edge cases when implementing functions.
Alexa also does what we want :DThat connecting everything to the internet is hard. Also that Alexa is harder to use than we thought.Implement a better natural language processing algorithm and also automatically linking whatsapp chats to a .txt file.

It will however never inform you about changes the other way around; you cannot see anyone unfriend you. We decided to change that.The Chrome extension works in the background and periodically checks your friend list on Facebook, by comparing your friend list to the last known one every time, it can see people disappearing from it. It saves the data on the hard drive, so it will work even if someone unfriends you while you have your browser - or even computer - off.When it detects that someone unfriended you, it displays a desktop notification and also connects to our bot which messages you directly about that fact.Additionally, it can also monitor the friends' lists of all your friends, informing you about the changes, so that you can know if someone unfriended one of your friends.We mostly used JavaScript to build the Chrome extension, utilizing AJAX for querying Facebook and HTML5 Local Storage for saving data. We built the bot in Node.js and Microsoft Bot Framework, but eventually settled on using Microsoft Flow, as it turned out to be better suited for the task, as suggested by a Microsoft representative.The Chrome extension was difficult to implement, as it tries to scrape Facebook's web pages without using any API's. This allows it to work without any authentication required and see the friends' lists of all your friends. Facebook's web pages load content (like the friend list) asynchronously in many steps, and so our code had to reflect that to work. After getting all the data, it had to be parsed to extract useful information from the returned mix of HTML and JavaScript.Our bot worked locally without any issues, but after we moved it to the Microsoft Azure's bot service, we ran into a problem, as it was unable to find some Node.js modules. A Microsoft representative told us it's likely to be an unknown bug due to it being a recently introduced service. As a solution we decided to use Microsoft Flow instead, which works without issues.The project works exactly as we envisioned. We successfully wrote a web scraper/parser for Facebook's data and a working bot.We learned about the different Microsoft Azure capabilities and about the process of making Chrome extensions. We also had the chance to discover that Facebook loads it's web pages in quite a convoluted way and that it's possible to monitor Facebook users' data without their knowledge, which is a privacy issue.We could extract more data from Facebook to monitor different kinds of user activity, and notify them of interesting events concerning them even if they don't use Unfriendly themselves.

245,IC Hack 17,245,,245,"File sharing, made easy.Demo GIFWe found sending files to people just next to you was more complicated than it needed to be! We realised that physical proximity didn't mean digital proximity - two people standing side-by-side might find it easy to talk verbally to one another, but their devices certainly wouldn't. Differing networks and differing operating systems make it difficult for devices that have had no prior communication to exchange data with one another.We wanted file-sharing between devices close to each other to be as seamless as two people talking to each other. This meant no messing around with email, or Google Drive, or anything that required the user to perform multiple steps.With FileBucket, file sharing is as easy as visiting the web-app online. The host, using his mobile phone, scans a QR code on each of the users' screens to form a group for file sharing. Each participant is automatically joined into the same group and is able to upload files to a shared 'bucket', accessible to everyone in the group.Once a sharing session is started, every participant gets access to the files until the host ends the session. Once ended, all files are emptied from the bucket.All without the need of any passwords or prior registration!HTML5 and JavaScript was used for the front-facing portion of the web-app, including QR code generation and drag-and-drop file upload. Ajax was used to exchange data between the client and the server asynchronously. We also used jQuery and Bootstrap.The server was built with Node.js, Express and with MySQL as a backing database. The server manages active connections between clients, and negotiates the establishment of connections to new clients when their unique QR code is scanned. Apart from Ajax requests, we also made use of the Pusher API to provide realtime notifications to the client on the state of the bucket, including whether new files have been delivered or when the bucket has been closed.The scanner application was written in Java, for the Android platform. With the app, we are able to initiate connections between users, remove members and monitor the number of members in the group.We deliberated for some time on the best way to make the experience seamless for the user. We experimented with passphrases, QR codes and even NFC tags to identify the two endpoints of a file transfer.We made file sharing much more effortless and seamless! (We hope!)We learned to use the Pusher API and some members of the team picked up Node.js and Express for server-side development.We want to explore ways to make transferring information even easier for users who use FileBucket often to share files with other people or even across their own devices. We think NFC tags could provide a one-tap way to seamlessly identify devices.IC Hack 17Raymond Tan

For the great promise of technology to be shared more equitably throughout the world we need a new solution. Despite a massive increase in availability of fantastic online courses, there has not been a course successful in engaging a large audience. Through gesture tracking with Kinect, fun art and an engaging story line, our project is an experiment in making learning as addictive as games!Kinecting the world is a multiplayer language learning game that comes with training and game mode. In training mode the player(s) can teach themselves Chinese by saying “Translate <English word/sentence>”, after which the recognised word is translated to Simplified Chinese. On the screen the player sees himself in the video stream from the Kinect with the translated Chinese symbols overlaid on top. By extending the hand towards the screen each player can trace the Chinese characters. Traces of more than one player are displayed in different brush colours. At any point through the game, the Chinese characters and brush strokes can be cleared by saying “Cancel”.
In game mode the player follows a both addictive and instructive story line that will teach some basic Chinese characters while the player fights his way from level to level to find the evil monster that has taken over Queen’s Tower (an iconic structure at Imperial College London).We built it using C#. We use the Kinect SDK for body tracking and to record colour images and sound. The sound is converted to text and then translated to Simplified Chinese using the Bing Speech API and Text Translator API as part of Microsoft’s Cognitive Services.We faced many challenges. Some of them include realising that the J4K library doesn't support audio streaming... so 8 hours in, we had to scrap the old program and restart with C# instead of Java. Another challenge was that C# was a completely new programming language for 3 of the members.None of us knew each other before we formed the team during the hackathon and we all come from different discipline/university/year and we are proud that we got a fun working project completed essentially under 16 hours. In addition the video demoing the storyline for the Kinect game was made in PowerPoint.Majority of us learned a new programming language and how pair-programming can improve efficiency. We also learned that it is possible to work 24 hours straight.A lot of effort went into the making both the storyline and the video for the game. Incorporating the storyline with different levels, whilst Trump being a protagonist would further enhance the already fun learning experience.IC Hack 17Shiny Ranjan

We are trying to see each other often, but we have a tight budget and we can't afford to spend a lot of money on flights. Fortunately, we have noticed that it is sometimes cheaper to take advantage of airline sales and get flights to another city rather than fly to see each other at our respective homes. This is awesome because we can not only see each other cheaply but also discover new cities and meet some wonderful people.Meet In The Middle is the only existing web application that allows you to browse flights to any destination from multiple starting points. So if you are here in London and your friend is back in Bratislava, you enter the 2 airports of origin and our web app offers you the selection of the cheapest flights that allow you to meet in different cities around the world. The flights have approximately matching arrival times, so you don't spend too much time on your own.We used skyscanner API to get the flight schedules and their prices. We process this information in our Python backend and show it nicely on frontend build using jquery and bulma css framework. We also use Google Maps API heavily, not only to conveniently plot the flight routes, but also to receive autocomplete or stock pictures to beautify our UI.We were having big problems with rate limiting on Skyscanner API, which is particularly strict on free account. Otherwise we were having trouble limiting the number of queries to Google Maps API, which is terribly slow.We are happy we were able to finish this hack in short time (we only had 16 hours, because we started of with a different idea that proved itself infeasible). Moreover, we feel that our product actually solves a real problem we were having and we are hoping to use it over the next years.We accumulated a bit of spaghetti code during the hackathon, so we need to do some refactoring to make the code maintainable.

253,IC Hack 17,253,,253,"A simulator to evolve Neural Networks to create the ultimate microbeWe decided to build a microbe simulator controlled by neural networks that could fight and consume food to control their environment. Each strain of microbe is given a random colour initially that all of its children receive to show the dominant strain after the simulation.Each microbe has a series of vision inputs which act like ray scanners. They have a 90 degree field of view which acts as the input to the neural network. If an object is seen in the way of the ray scanner then the input assigned to that ray scanner is one, otherwise it is 0.The neural network then evolves through a genetic algorithm we implemented to find and search for food. The output of the neural network is speed and direction of the microbe.All code was implemented by hand in java with no additional libraries apart from use of the built in Java awt rendering library.IC Hack 17I developed the neural network and the genetic algorithm for making the microbe produce behaviour and evolve.

It prompted us to create an app that would use your Facebook profile data to recommend movies.The app fetches data from your Facebook profile, and sends that data to a server that runs a sparse denoising auto-encoder. The trained auto-encoder then sends a list of recommended movies based on the liked Facebook movies. Furthermore movies can be browsed on based on genre/decade/rating on the app through the TMBD-api. It provides a clear swip-card interface that allows users to bookmark suggested movies or ignore it.-
Using react-native we created a front-end of the app. The Facebook-sdk allowed us to collect liked movies-titles from facebook. Then using TMBD we fetched the remaining details of the movie. The app provides two main functionality. The movies liked facebook are sent to our server, written in python, which runs a denoising auto-encoder with the use of TenssorFlowm and returns recommended movies based on feature vectors.

What they lack is the interface to provide inspiration, and the ability to quickly explore different places around the world.GlobeScope is a web-app that allows the user to quickly find information about a destination, like flight prices, general description, photos, weather reports and so on. The app returns the data quickly, and the interface is responsive. This allows the user to efficiently explore different areas and find inspiration by hopping from place to place.The web-app is a primarily front end application. The site was built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All the APIs were called using jQuery in JavaScript. We needed a responsive and fluid globe with a map overlay, to do this we used and open source JavaScript library called Cesium, and accessed this with Node.JS.A large problem we had was synchronisation of API functions. In some functions, we needed to pass one or more API calls, into another API call. Simply writing line by line would not have given the AJAX requests enough time to return their responses. To allow time for this, we used a combination of chaining callback functions, and using 'promises' in JavaScript where appropriate. We also had to consider that sometimes, API requests do not come back successful, and we had to be ready to accept failed, or partial responses. The Expedia API, whilst containing very rich data, had a complex data structure which involved retrieving a 'LegID' from one area of the structure, and looking that ID up in another part.Being first years and in our first hackathon, we also found the division of tasks and merging of code an interesting challenge, sometimes we had performed unit testing that had passed, and later found that when the functions were chained together, they often had unexpected edge cases that we had to account for. This required good planning and prior agreements of what data and arguments we would be passing to each other.Only one of the members of our group had ever had experience with front end and web development. Within 2 days, the rest of us had learnt how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript with jQuery and AJAX calls to make and process API requests, and render their results to the webpage. We were proud to produce a finished and smart product that works as designed.We learned about the challenges of delayed responses in AJAX requests, and how to handle them using chained callbacks and JavaScript promises. We also learned how to traverse JSON data structures to build objects and 'craft' the data that we required from them.GlobeScope could make use of far more APIs, in particular (if we were able to become reputable), using the TripAdvisor API, as it is only available to reviewed applicants or their API. This would enable us to not only return reviews of places, but find similar places to the destinations that the user is searching. We could also link the user's profile to Facebook or other social networks, and use big data algorithms to match their attributes to other user's search responses, and even more intelligently suggest places that the user might like to visit.If we had had a little more time, we would have incorporated package holidays from Expedia's API, as well as finding the most popular times of year to visit, to develop infographics of price changes throughout the year.IC Hack 17Rohan Pritchard

There is not a hint of hope in them. We decided to bring a change to headlines you encounter on a daily basis with this Alexa skill called Content.Google defines the word 'Content' as information made available by a website or other electronic medium.
It also defines it as a state of peaceful happiness. Our aim is to bring positive news articles forward and hence the name.Content provides positive headlines in various categories to you. It will also text you the link of the article if you are interested in further reading.We used the Bing Search API for Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services to obtain news headlines in 6 different categories (World News, Politics, Entertainment, Business, Sports and Technology). We then fed each headline into the Google Text Analytics API which assigned a sentiment score from -1 to 1 with -1 being highly negative and 1 being highly positive. When the user ask Alexa if there are any positive headlines in a particular category, a randomly selected rating with a sentiment score of 0.7 or higher will be read out by Alexa and if the user is interested in reading the news article, the user will receive a text from Alexa with the news article's link.The biggest challenge we faced was Google Text Analytics API assigning a positive rating to news headlines a human would consider highly negative. That is why the threshold of 0.7 was selected in order to ensure that highly positive headlines will be read outWe learnt use and deploy Azure and Google Cloud services.

For example, a playlist containing both classical and hip hop music, of which the user enjoys both of, may not flow well in the wrong environment or mood. It may also be displeasing for the user to hear such a wide varation in songs.ContextualShuffle loads the entirety of your music library and learns associations between specific categories of music. Using these categories and other song-specific features such valence, tempo, and genre, similarities are identified between other songs in your library, without any intervention on your part. Similar songs are then queued (shuffled) such that the genre or other features of importance does not vary too much from song to song. 
By monitoring the user's facial expressions, the efficacy of the queuing system is further adapted and improved each iteration.Starting with the initial aim of identifying similar songs, a large music dataset was required. We sought to acquire features and labels that were most relevant for every track in the dataset. We identified the following features as critical in classification of each track:An ensemble of a 1000 decision trees was trained with boosting to extract feature importance, corresponding to the above features. The features were then normalized between -1 and 1 to allow for an easier evaluation. Using the resulting features we calculated, the cross-correlation between different songs was calclated and an incrementally built list of succeedingly similar songs was continually adapted using positive and negative emotions determined by Microsoft's Cognitive API service.Following this, when a user plays a given song from their library, the most similar songs to each corresponding song are played successivelly. This means the first song's nearest neighbour is played. The neighbour then becomes the root from which calculations are considered, and it's nearest neighbour is played and so on. This provides a good balance of variation and consistency between tracks.OpenCV has posed multiple difficulties due to version compatibility and limited support for python 2.7. Even after installing it for  Python3 a large amount of time was needed for everythin to work as intended. 
The Spotify API download rate has posed a significant problem due to the large amount of training data that was required by our algorithms.
The Azure API examples could improve in terms of documentation.
Running Webcams through virtual machines was nearly impossible, so we had to resort to communicating to external mobile devices.
Labelling of genres, and appropriate mining of data was difficult to achieve due to 
Communication between different technologies was difficult and rather consuming.We believe this product is workable, usable, and performs in-line with our initial aims and goals
The large amount of different technologies into the product has given us a brief but enjoyable experience with each of them.
Generating and creating workable training and testing datasets given the large amonut of variables in a given track.Avoid OpenCV if possible.
Learning about different APIs and libraries in order to achieve a niche task.
Keep your front and back end separated if possible.We'd love to reach out to the team at Spotify and discuss how our findings could help them improve their technologies and how additional features in their APIs could assist developersIC Hack 17I handled the Microsoft azure API, high level data mining and genre classificationDaniel Morris

We show the world as a heat map, using Twitter to analyze current emotions.This is an application, currently for Android, that allows the user to type in a keyword. Upon submission, the user is brought to a map of the world, which is appropriately shaded for each region based on the sentiments of the tweets sent from that area. All tweets are analyzed with a machine learning algorithm that gives the tweets a coefficient of positivity and negativity, which we use to determine the shade of the specific region. Sample tweets hover around the regions, too, giving the user a very immersive and cool experience.The front-end team (Julian Chow, Rishi Rabheru, Ashley See, and James Tavernor) used Java to code the user interface. The back-end team (Anthony Alridge, Nicholas Li, and Shravan Nageswaran) used Python to import and customize a machine learning algorithm to analyze the sentiment of the tweets, retrieve tweets from many regions, and combine these two to create a map that linked coordinates of the world to the appropriate colour of the map representation. Ultimately, we connected these programs well and made the full application.The API would only provide us with 2500 tweets per minute (and we wanted a lot of data). Because of this, we limited the ICHACK version of the app to major cities in the United Kingdom and Ireland, but we look to continue developing the app to make it a worldwide representation.We are very proud of optimizing the machine learning algorithm to process each tweet quickly. Additionally, implementing and manipulating a map in Android is quite challenging, and our front-end team did a phenomenal job of doing that. Plus, all of our code is readable, and the app, itself, is simple for users to pick up and enjoy!We learned that processing data poses its challenges - especially when we want to analyze millions of tweets! Additionally, from ICHACK, we taught ourselves how to combine front-end and back-end work to accomplish the endeavor of a comprehensive application. It was a very enjoyable, hard-working, and rewarding experience.Heatwave is continuing to be improved. Once we can process more data, we will make Heatwave assess all cities around the world. Additionally, we look to continue improving the graphics, adding a blend method that will appropriately blend two colours in adjacent regions to make the entire map look more cohesive. All in all, we wanted to create an app that is unique, insightful, and - quite frankly - fun, and that is what we did! But we are not done yet.IC Hack 17Anthony-Alridge

Using the Alexa API we built the Alexa skill.It took us 8 hours for the server to say ""Hello World"" and a lot longer for the Echo Dot to say it. We had to learn how lambda functions work for the AWS Lambda. Alexa took a while to recognise our commands to the skill.Alexa managed to pronounce the tongue twisters clearly. The whole program runs, despite the little challenges at the beginning.We got to use and experiment with the Echo Dot for the first time. We realised that you should not use reserved or common words for the invocation name for a skill as Alexa will not recognise the skill properly. Most of all, we learned to use the Amazon Web Services, the Alexa API, as well as Javascript.In the future we would like to increase the database for the tongue twisters.

Now I fully intended to leave early, only drink 2 pints, but somehow, not for lack of trying ended up worse for wear, hanging in a lecture theatre, about to start a 36 hour hackathon (again). I'm not alone in this. It is so easy to fool yourself,  but data doesn't lie, machine learning can be used in an app to tell you whether you should go home.""Should I go home?"" is a humourous web app where people can go on and answer a sequence of 6 tick box questions before being told whether they should a) continue drinking full steam ahead, b)have one more drink, c) go home, what are you even doing out in the first place. The results are calculated using a cognitive service regression algorithm, based off peoples past drinking experiences and how worth it they were.I think it has real application for the student market, excessive alcohol consumption is a problem, but no one wants to be controlled. Most PSAs are unappealing, and struggle to be relateable plus it's really hard to judge your drunkness levels even based on your own past experiences. ""Should I go home?"" removes these issues, giving a reliable, impartial source, informed by your peers past actions and has a fun, simple user interface.The web app was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, handlebars and node. As users would answer 6, multiple choice button questions. Its designed to be quick, simple and humourous to appeal to its target drunk, student audience. Once their 6 responses had been recorded, this data could be sent to the azure api, and in response the app would receive a ""worthit"" score for the person to keep drinking.To start with users are asked what kind of drinker are they: light weight (penguin, cos feathers are light), heavy weight (bears, because bears are bare heavy) and average (""pengbears a cross between the two."")I posted a survey to reddit where I asked people to describe their recent drinking experiences. They answered the same 6 questions as on the website, plus one evaluation question of how worth it the night was (used as the label score), These were used to train the algorithm, the higher the worth it score, the more likely my web app recommended to continue drinking.The node.js was more rudimentary than I would have liked, I could not solve a bug that prevented browsers registering modified XHR, so the url could not be updated on the website. It was very frustrating as it was a matter of configuration of static files rather than something directly related to programming. This prevents multiple users using the website at once, or me exploring session data etc.I managed to quickly get accurate outputs for a trained machine learning algorithm to use in the app, I really enjoyed developing the graphics and my ""pengbear"" is baller.I learned how to develop a node.js application with good structure between dynamic and static content. Also how to call azure apis, and use their cognitive services.In the future I would want to integrate it with the mobile platform, so that accelerometers could detect whether someone was ignoring the apps advice, and based on that decide whether to help the student in the morning with ""how to deal with your hangover"" advice. Also instead of training the API on such a small dataset, users would have the option to input their own experiences to add to the dataset or validate how effective the apps recommendations had been the morning after.
With a larger dataset, the number of possible questions could be far greater, including maths problems to evaluate someones current cognitive skills, and a small subset of these could be chosen, to keep the app interesting.IC Hack 17rebecca simpson

After identifying these words we used the word association API to compose relevant words related to the poems. Furthermore, we implemented our own poetic sentence structure to give the poems a natural feel and flow naturally.No one in our team had experience with Python so this was a huge learning experience. Furthermore, this was first time our team was using API's and integrating them together. Coming up with poetic sentence structures and associated words from the image key words proved to be the biggest challenge.We manage to create cool poems most of the times!

Furthermore, this hackathon gave us a great idea of how Machine Vision works and how useful they can be in various applications. Additionally, we were grateful on the great documentation provided by Microsoft that made our life a lot easier using the API's.We would like to create better sentence structure that is more accurate grammatically as well as making the poems more meaningful.

We were really inspired by the artwork of many horror games, thus we decided to use our own original artwork for the game.It is a standalone horror game, utilising sound effects, tension and psychological stimuli to enhance the overall experience of the gamer. This was enhanced using live heartrate data, emotional analysis and the element of surprise.Two of us worked a lot on the artwork, using Adobe Photoshop CS6 (one did mock sketches on pen & paper and the other refined those sketches digitally). The other three members mainly worked on programming, splitting different language requirements for our game.We found doing the artwork incredibly challenging, as we found that it was more time consuming than we originally thought. Additionally, the difficulty of creating a feasible story line was greater than we thought.We managed to make a game on which we received very positive feedback from various other IC Hackathon participants (we managed to scare them). We believe the original drawings we produced for the game were very successful and fit the horror atmosphere of the game. Sound effects were used incredibly well in combination with our graphical effects.We learned how to keep awake and work efficiently under sleep deprivation. We additionally learned how to work more effectively as a team. Our team got on very well and we are happy to work together again in the future. We learned how to modify audio (e.g. from third party sources), how to use Photoshop to enhance our artwork and in particular we learned how to modify voices of our team members.Although we have plenty of user interaction, we want to further enhance this area, by implementing hand gestures to allow users to interact with the game using the video motion API (Microsoft). If the game is longer, we could store data from the user (given the user's permission of course) into a database and perform data analysis from this.

Hardened dildo.io is a a paper that describes how to build a similar system, with the additional property that the server can't know who you like and dislike.Our goal for ICHack 17 was to implement the Hardened Dildo.io paper as a web application.HardCrypto is a private and cryptographically secure matchmaking service, aimed at student communities, that can guarantee to keep your likes and preferences private without having to trust the server (and whoever hacks into it).It's like Tinder, but only with verified people from your school, and nobody except for you can know who you like. Or philosophy is one where we put users preference first and assume all options are opt in and that no information (such as sexual orientation) is assumed.The core idea behind HardCrypto is Homomorphic Encryption, a form of encryption that allows computations to be carried out on the ciphertexts without revealing the plaintext. When every user joins, they create an RSA key pair for signing and encrypting messages and publish their public key. Then, for every other user in the system, a Paillier key pair is generated and sent to the other user encrypted with their public RSA key. The server can then perform operations on the numbers encrypted with the Paillier key pair.Our stack is built in EcmaScript 6.

I also have information on the upvote ratio, total post score, whether the top comment was gilded, etc. Lots of data (but annoyingly, limited to n=1000 because after that I get various HTTP errors from PRAW/urllib).Data was then imported in R/RStudio, in which I used a set of data analysis and visualisation tools that I'm already comfortable with. Microsoft cognitive services was used to tag sentence topics and score emotions from 0 to 1, but I also used outside data to get a more fine grained view of emotion.Lots of new tech O_O. Issues with request timeouts, and lots of trouble with Pusher. Still, happy I got something off the ground.Never mined Reddit before, but have been wanting to since I'm a total Reddit fanboy.Lots about reddit's internal structure, and more generally how to mine reddit data :)Patching up the existing analyses, and extending into mapping the linguistic structures by candidate (maybe a model could identify Trump's distinctive stoccato, rambling style?).I also think that doing emotion detection in the faces of political leaders in photos of political meetings could be insightful - if one leader is looking happy and another is annoyed, this could be a predictor of a bad meeting, which could have potentially worldwide significance.Hack Cambridge RecurseNatasha Latysheva

One computer vision task that benefits from such clear gains is facial recognition (identifying a person based on his/her face)---a deep neural network being the primary tool used for this purpose at Facebook, among other places.One natural extension of the above could be to exploit neural networks within a secure application, in order to authenticate a person based on a shot of their face. Unfortunately, despite the apparently superb performance of such models, it is fairly easy to construct inputs which can trick the network into authenticating a stranger (commonly known as adversarial examples). We built FaceJack in order to illuminate this concept. In particular, we'd like to emphasise:But let's take it slowly---what even are adversarial inputs?Adversarial inputs are made possible by the very design of neural networks. On a high level, a neural network consumes an input, performs several transformations to it, in order to predict a corresponding output. The network parameters are adjusted by running the network on a training set (a set of known input/output pairs from which the network needs to generalise). The network's transformations are designed to be differentiable, so that the network can be efficiently trained by:The network's differentiability allows us to consider the error function in its parameters, for a fixed input and output---so we can optimise them. However, it also allows us to set up an error function in the input, for a fixed choice of parameters---so we can modify the input to produce a desirable output. If the ""desirable"" output classification is one that the original input does not belong to (e.g. classifying my face as John Travolta), then the constructed input represents an adversarial example. Deep neural networks are particularly vulnerable to such inputs, for three main reasons:Therefore, using neural networks in secure applications requires particular care, as adversarial inputs give rise to a potentially unforeseen covert channel for an exploit.We have built FaceJack as a simple representative of such an exploit:Hopefully, FaceJack has achieved its objective of highlighting this important issue in a clear and concise fashion. We hope to expand it in the near future with further authentication attacks, for example speech recognition-based ones.MIT

Afterwards, I fine-tuned it with the dataset of faces we built during the hackathon, which included Laurynas (the admin) and the rest of us (adversarial examples).I created the webcam hooks, computer vision part leveraging face detectors, server to receive images and perform the authentication, and gathered and processed the training dataset.Edgar Liberis

As it is difficult to get out of the work zone, we propose a nerdy and fun solution that also takes good care of your health. Inspired by the Arthritis Research UK, we designed a software that encourages the programmers to remotely control the game flow while exercising the neck and face muscles.It allows the users to remotely control the game using the movement of their necks and heads in near real time, which are based on the simple excercises recommended by the Arthritis Research UK. Consequently it releases the tension and allows you to take a break from intensive work. More importantly, it is a great fun!We used the Microsoft Cognitive Services, in particular, faces and emotions APIs to track the position of the head with respect to xy axes in order to link the user movement to the game control. In addition, a twist was added with the emotions API to perform certain actions with some facial expressions. We used Pygame and multithreading to control the game flow in near real time. We implemented two games, a Tetris and a Football dribbler for different target groups.

286,Hack Cambridge Recurse,286,,286,"eXplore makes science education interactive and personalised!Decreasing costs of genome sequencing have brought forward a new era for personalised genomics. In 2016, over 1 million individuals had had their genome sequenced, with over 80% of them expressing an interest in taking part in research.Even with this abundance of genomics data, an obstacle remains to translational research: the communication between institutions and research participants is static and often unilateral.We believe that scientific research and progress in medical research should be facilitated by ease of communication between stakeholders without a third-party restricting access to invaluable data. We decided to build a tool that facilitates this communication by giving back content to users that is directly relevant to them in plain language. We hope that clarity and personalisation will sustain participation and accumulation of valuable data over time.eXplore tailors research findings to users' individual genotypes, making research content directly relevant to them. We curate scientific reports that summarise the literature avoiding jargon and making it fully interactive. As users read through the report, they get personalised insights based on their unique DNA. We make it very easy for them to understand where they fit in and what they can learn about themselves from the research they're reading.We use eLife Lens API to display the content in a user-friendly way so that users can browse through content seamlessly. We offer basic science explanations on any term that we think might be difficult to understand for a reader with no background in science and tailor the content to their genotype.We use 23andme API for seamless integration of the genomic data and guarantee safety and privacy through encryption.The idea behind eXplore was to make genetics education and research a lot more interactive. Research is way too dry, so even though people are really interested in learning more, there is a big barrier to entry. As scientists, we loved the way the eLife Lens made scientific articles easier and more intuitive to parse through. We thought that we could re-purpose this open source project to do the same thing for public engagement with science. Instead of annotating a research article with figures and references, we used the right hand panel of the Lens format to display definitions for hard-to-understand concepts. We also added a personal element to the research being presented by taking individual genetic data (drawn from somewhere such as 23andMe) to allow the reader to check whether a particular genetic variant described in the article (e.g. one that makes coriander taste like soap) applies to them.The main challenge was learning some node.js and the specifics of the XML format used by the eLife lens project in order to alter the code base to make this happen!Our team did not have experience working with node.js, so finding my way through the eLife lens API in this new language was a real challenge and kept me locked to the screen well into the night.Taking an open-source project and breaking it down piece by piece to add new features was really exciting. I especially enjoyed ‘learning by breaking’ by deleting parts of the code to understand what was ‘mission critical’ and what we could play with.Beyond navigating node.js and having fun with eLife Lens API, we learnt that there is a lot to be done on how to engage users with scientific content. It's something the three of us have felt passionate about for a long time and this hackaton has provided us to opportunity to see that it is indeed possible with a bit of work and motivation!We really want to work on developing our content and functionalities further so that we can share our passion for genetics with a larger audience and help people realise how much they can gain from research.We have learnt a lot during these past two days and feel very excited about developing eXplore further. The next step for us is to integrate user feedback by integrating checkbox that encourage them to verify whether what we think we know about their genotype applies to them. In our example for taste preference, we introduce a mutation that predispose individuals to disliking coriander. We want users to be able to tick a checkbox that says ""That's not true for me"" and gain insights as we go.We also want to develop a chrome extension so that when users click on references in our articles, they can directly open a PubMed or eLife article and see highlighted in blue the key points of the article and in yellow the parts that directly relate to their genotypes, without having to read the entire paper.We also need to develop many more curated reports and we're thinking of making this an open source project for geneticists worldwide to contribute and propose research projects that users can participate to.Hack Cambridge RecurseI worked mostly on curating content for the reports, going through scientific article to create a comprehensive summary of SNPs and allele interpretation to make it easy to understand for our users. I brainstormed the features that our users would want to see in our reports and on ways to integrate scientific research in a user friendly-way to encourage them to explore further. We all contributed to coming up with a long-term strategy on our product implementationI forked the eLife Lens project and hacked away trying to make it work for us! It took some time for me to wrap my head around the node.js and xml, but surprised at how much we could do in such a short time.Also used the Pubmed python API and the eLife API to pull all of the articles related to a particular genetic variant - we didn't have time to fully implement this feature but it is high on the priority list!Made some small contributions from my bed, sipping on some lemsip, while my kick ass teammates hacked through the night and wrote some great content.Charlotte Guzzo

However, we're still very far from professional presenters, such as TED talks speakers. Of course, the best feedback you can have on your presentation is the public's reaction. But how can you measure your impact on the public, especially if you are busy managing the stress of giving the talk?Using a camera, you can record the audience while you are giving a presentation, and then upload that video on Cognitive Services web dashboard. It extracts frames every 2 seconds and continuously analyses the public's emotions, plotting them against the presentation audio/video. It calculates the attention of the public for each frame, plotting it so that you are able to see when exactly in your talk there was an attention drop. You can also check if people reacted to what you said in the way you wanted. For example, if you said a joke 20 seconds in, but there was no indication of an increase in happiness around that timestamp, it could mean there is room for improvement.We created a web dashboard in HTML, javascript and CSS, powered by PHP as backed. It processes the upload and then executes three python scripts that split the video in key frames and key audio's, perform the API calls to Microsoft Cognitive services and get the emotion analysis for all the frames and the sentiment analysis for the text, and format everything in a JSON file, while also calculating the attention and other analytics. 
Then, back in the web dashboard, the JSON file is read into multiple javascript functions that plot the results.Biggest challenge was getting opencv to run. There were numerous dependencies to compile from source, not available as binaries, and it did not work from the first time. Also, we ran into problems making it work on Windows, which made testing harder, because on Macs we had problems getting the apache server to work properly.
Another big problem was the initial limitation of API calls, which only allowed a maximum of 20 seconds of video. In the morning we received an Azure API key from Microsoft, which allowed us to implement a working solution. Moreover, customising the audio/video player was a problem, and integrating it with the graphs, in order to properly show the data at appropriate times.We completed a fully working MVP which is actually useful as it is, delivering value to the user even in its current form. Because there are a vast amount of possible uses for Cognitive Crowds, we believe it has a strong business potential. We think this is the most important, because once you prove something can be done, half the work is done.We learned a variety of new things, such as image processing with opencv, building complex pipelines and integrating different technologies, data analysis and much more. Most importantly, we realised how useful it can be to analyse the emotions of the people and how many applications it has. If it is used in combination with other technologies such as text analysis, it becomes a very powerful tool that can provide a very accurate constructive feedback.The current implementation is just barely touching the huge potential of this idea. We plan to use it in combination with a variety of regression algorithms to correlate the key phrases of your speech with the public's reactions, so it can automatically suggest what subjects you have to touch in order to inflict a given emotion to your audience. As a business model, we can provide the software as a service to venues/event organisers, in order for them to attract better speakers and to help them improve themselves. Also, it can be provided to university lecturers, helping them with as-objective-as-possible constructive feedback about their classes (everyone knows students usually over-grade their lecturers in the end-of-the-year feedback forms).Hack Cambridge RecurseAlex Radu

However, test sticks covered with chemicals that change color  depending on the properties of the water (like the famous Litmus test for the ph-value) are very cheap to produce and easy to use. However, reading out the correct values can be a bit tricky and since many people actually own smartphones anyway we wanted to come up with a way to combine the two.Our App automates the process of reading out the values from the color coding of a mock up test stick. Just focus with your camera and the app will tell you the ph-value associated with the sample you provided.We used OpenCv in C++ for the technical part of the app. First we normalize the input image (similar to what happens when you scan QR codes). This means that even slightly tilted or rotated input works fine with the algorithm (most of the time :P). As the next step we extract the color values from the normalized image by averaging over certain areas.We have stored a table containing color codes for various chemicals and ph values, so that then we are able to perform a simple optimization in order to find the ph value that matches the theoretical data best.The app itself is written in a mix of Swift 3 (for the interface) and ObjectiveC (to communicate with our C++ code).Neither of us had experience in mobile development, so getting to grips with Swift and ObjectiveC was a struggle.

This year, we carried on the theme of exploring how human interaction with computers will change in the future.Its a 3 - dimensional IDE which incorporates mouseless interaction.We used an Oculus Rift and a Leap Motion device.We did everything in java. We used the JOGL library to communicate directly to an Oculus Rift. We also, used the jovr library to translate java into OpenGL. Thankfully the interaction between the leap motion device was also done in java.A LOT of challenges were overcome. First, the Oculus Rift demands a lot of graphical processing power. Out of three laptops we could only run it on a mac. Oculus has dropped all support for mac users which meant we could only run the Oculus on very old drivers. Hence, documentation was rather hard to come by. In addition to this, since we were running older drivers we could not take advantage of easier VR techniques such as WebVr. Hence, we were forced to use JOGL bindings to write directly to the oculus rift display and JOVR to read the IMU data from Oculus.  Thus, we have completed a vr project in java!I think the most important thing is - we did it ! We've had this idea for a very long time and we ran into so many problems. At certain points it looked as if the idea was achievable and we would be left with partial bits of code . However, we never ever gave up and tried absolutely everything. To incorporate the leap motion as well, is an added bonus since it enhances the unique property of our project.Vr requires a lot of processing power  and where there's a will there's a way ! Seriously, having to use the Oculus where there is no support and being forced to use technology we weren't used to was an absolute pain! But we regret nothing because we achieved an amazing product in the end.V-de is a working concept that has the potential to redefine the relationship between humans and computers. So far it's and IDE for developers. Imagine if you could see the effects of your code whilst you are coding. All achievable in the Oculus.

Yet despite the huge uptake, there remains a lack of support for the visually impaired. We believe that the user experience of the visually impaired would be greatly enhanced by providing feedback through facial recognition and interpretation of the expressions of the people they are talking to.eMotion aims to address the lack of support for the visually impaired by harnessing a Microsoft Cognitive API to provide real-time information on facial expressions during a video call. The API interprets a still image of the video call and calculates the likelihood of different emotions. A customisable sound-effect is then played to inform the user of the most likely emotion.The peer2peer connection is established and maintained using WebRTC, Node.js, and socket.io. Video streams are embedded in the html code using Javascript, which also powers the back-end.A key issue was that domains that we created were unable to stream video because the location was not considered secure enough. Socket.io is very hard to implement on cloud systems. The Microsoft API was incredibly useful, but involved a steep learning curve.We are proud of how quickly we were able to adapt to challenges outside of our usual comfort zones by trying out new technologies and languages.Coming from a wide variety of backgrounds, we were each able to learn a great deal about each other's skillsets.Hack Cambridge RecurseI worked on our version of the Emotion-API and helped with css and html.ErmeHarrier

Any publication will occupy some subspace of this hyperspace. Conventional literature searches provide the publications that intersect some subspace, usually defined by a keywords. More recent social media/bot approaches try to interpret the subspace the user is familiar with and suggest publications that exist at or just outside the boundary of this familiarity. Our service provides a means of bridging between the subspace of knowledge which the user knows and their search subspace. This is done by presenting the minimum necessary publications required for the user to traverse between these subsapces.Publication subspace coverage is approximated as nodes and the hyperspace is projected onto a network with distances between nodes as approximations to the distances within the hyperspace.These distance estimates are an aggregations of several factors including whether the papers are citation/reference connected (first degree connection), how many shared cited/referencing papers they have (second degree connections) and overlap of keywords. More could include text analysis of abstract/full text analysis; author input; experint input; user input or others.A shortest path is found on a network of unity weight edges for distances below a threshold and weights penalised above unity for distances above the threshold. This threshold is to model the users ability to move outside his field of knowledge. So papers they find comfortable learning are included but papers that they would find challeneging are penalised.Hack Cambridge RecurseJeremy Minton

This inspired me to create an app that would automatically generate the hash tags for me based on the image context. I also wanted a method of posting to Instagram through a different platform (not only restricted to my IPhone Instagram App).InstaVision is a web application that allows users to upload a photo, automatically generate hash tags with the click of a button and post the photo to their Instagram account.I used Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision API to analyse the uploaded image and return a list of keywords which are converted into hashtags that are inserted into the caption.
I built the back-end using PHP and various third party APIs such as Imgur API for uploading an image to cloud temporarily and NXS API for posting to Instagram.
For the front-end, I used Javascript/JQuery and AJAX for submitting form data to the API endpoint and handling image uploads, and I used HTML/CSS and the Bootstrap framework for the basic user interface.I learnt a lot about the Microsoft Cognitive Services and it's various APIs and how to utilise them in PHP.

Cristian Axenie, Simeon Kostadinov, Mark MathewsIt has been estimated that 33% of people age 65 will fall. At around 80, that increases to 50%. In
case of a fall, seniors who receive help within an hour have a better rate of survival and, the faster
help arrives, the less likely an injury will lead to hospitalization or the need to move into a long-term
care facility. In such cases fast visual detection of abnormal motion patterns is crucial.In this project we propose the use of a novel embedded Dynamic Vision Sensor (eDVS) for the task of classifying falls. Opposite from
standard cameras which provide a time sequenced stream of frames, the eDVS provides only relative
changes in a scene, given by individual events at the pixel level. Using this different encoding scheme
the eDVS brings advantages over standard cameras. First, there is no redundancy in the data received
from the sensor, only changes are reported. Second, as only events are considered the eDVS data rate is
high. Third, the power consumption of the overall system is small, as just a low-end microcontroller is
used to fetch events from the sensor and can ultimately run for long time periods in a battery powered
setup. This project investigates how can we exploit the eDVS fast response time and low-redundancy
in making decisions about elderly motion.The computation backend will be realized with a neural network classificator to detect fall and filter outliers. The data will
be provided from 2 stimuli (blinking LEDs at different frequencies) and will represent the actual position of the person wearing them.
The changes in position of the stimuli will encode the possible positions corresponding to falls or normal cases.We will use Microsoft Azure ML Studio to implement a MLP binary classifier for the 4 (2 stimuli x 2 Cartesian coordinates - (x,y) in the field of view) dimensional input. We labelled the data with Fall (F) and No Fall (NF).Hack Cambridge RecurseCristian Axenie

Allowing you to join or create a team that will give you the top hackathon experience.The bot collects information about each user when they join the Slack group, taking information from their Github and Devpost accounts, as well as mentor and team statuses.By talking to the Cam Bot on the Slack account you can find out more about individual users and get lists of mentors or people looking for a team (which you can filter depending on any language requirements).When you ask about a specific user the Cam Bot will send you screenshots of the user's Github and Devpost pages, their team and mentor statuses, the languages they know, and links to their Github, Devpost and LinkedIn account. You can ask the bot for a list of mentors or people looking for a team, which you can then explore individually in  more detail. You can also update your team status, and view your profile.We are running two Node.js servers that exchange data via a REST API.One is used to control the chatbot itself and manage chat session data. It uses the Microsoft Bot Framework, which allows us to deploy our bot to several platforms easily - we currently have Slack and Facebook Messenger integration (although the primary use should be via Slack).Our second server manages user profiles, authentication, user OAuth tokens for 3rd party API integrations, and handles rendering of user image-dashboards - we are using a headless WebKit, PhantomJS, to render screenshots of new users' GitHub and Devpost previews. It later serves these assets for the chatbot controller to use them.
Here we also handle team formations and persist user data.The Cam Bot can already be used in any Slack group, as long as the Slack admin adds Cam Bot to the group.

Make informed decisions backed by your data!Input data via interactive chatbotintuitive data presentation for analysisWe noticed that minor medical conditions often are hard to pin down. Examples include skin irritation, indigestion, or migraine. To make matters worse, the causes for such symptoms are unique to each person. Therefore, we set out on a simple and yet challenging task to create personalised data tracking that is accessible to everyone.In addition, we realised that the same platform can be used to make informed decisions about our lives. In my personal dataset that was uploaded to the server we saw that productivity suffers from alcohol. (More subtile correlations were excluded for privacy reasons)Briefly, it interactively collects users data via chat-bots (slack/facebook/skype) and present analysed data back to the users. The user can pick the objectives he is interested in and our server picks the most important questions to ask. When there is enough data, the platform suggests an informed decision.We started off by brainstorming ideas through the email conversation, which was started by the organising team. Hence, we already knew what we wanted to do when we arrived – some conceptual design was followed by flowcharts and the build began. With 2-4 hours of sleep, the team was up and running for most of the time. The time was well spent and we have succeeded to make an MVP!We encountered 3 main challenges : the Bot itself is stateless, and integrating State into such a complex system makes for a very sensitive process of compile-run-debug, which often times turned frustrating. Debugging seemed somewhat difficult since the system seemed to behave differently locally and on azure, so we needed to deploy and use the bot itself to get messages. The second problem was getting the Scala web back-end to connect to SQL Server, which was incredibly difficult (had to basically write an entire Java wrapper library) due to poor compatibility between Scala and JDBC. Our last problem was not getting the Amazon Alexa to work, which we attribute to the fact that the bot turned out to be a lot more complex to build than we had thought and so we ran out of time.Add security layers, make it fully scalable, add dynamic NLP using MS Cog Services.

We live in a world where walls are built while people leave their homes, seeking for help. Our endeavour was to model the migration of individuals in a fictional universe, in order to showcase the dynamic way in which people immigrate, and how this impacts the population and living standards in each country. This kind of simulation would be the answer to many ""What if...?"" questions governments, scientists or economists could ask. These answers would not only allow proactive measures to be taken, but could save lives.Using SpatialOS, we have built a large scale simulation of migration in the magical World of Warcraft. The current model consists of 10 countries between which thousands of people migrate. The phenomenon is based on both personal and regional characteristics, each movement having a certain probability of occurring at any given time. The model is flexible and permits simulation based on customizable parameters, making it a useful tool for governments which want to be prepared for an influx of immigrants, or in case of natural disasters or even war. Or if somebody decides to build a wall.We built the project using C# and integrating the map and movement of people in unity, and used SpatialOS to run the simulation at large scale. Starting from a simple model of random migration, we then used probability theory and population dynamics to mathematically describe the phenomenon.Learning the structure and functionality of SpatialOS and integrating it with unity were two of the major challenges we faced. Finding a relatively simple mathematical model to realistically describe immigration was also a challenging task.We learned how to use SpatiolOS and integrate it with unity. Even though the learning process took a lot of time and we faced a lot of challenges, we managed to fix many of the bugs and to deliver a functional product.The hackathon has been an invaluable learning experience, as we started from scratch with SpatialOS and spent the first few hours of the hackathon learning its structure, functionality and particularities. We also read various research papers on immigration, population dynamics and migration modeling. Besides, we improved our knowledge of C# and learned unity.The next important steps are building larger maps and modeling more parameters which determine the probability of migration. By introducing these features, we will increase the flexibility of the platform, making it able to simulate migration at continent and even global level.

We filter the posts by the provided phrase. We then consider the Sentiment of each post using Microsoft Cognitive Services.

We can see this being applied in areas where full attention of the user is required for high security reasons, such as in the following two use cases:Used a popular open-source project, Boss Sensor as inspiration to use face recognition via deep learning, training on examples of faces. The deep learning is performed by using Tensor flow and Keras. To get the video feed, we're using OpenCV.-- Using Tensor flow and Keras for deep learning.

This is mainly due to the complex nature of modern scientific findings which makes them difficult to break down to a simple level. Alongside this, opportunities to have a dialogue with experts is often limited. 
We think that everyone benefits from the outcome of scientific studies and therefore a quick and simple way of communicating the results needs to be created. Through a live chat, the general public is able to learn about modern research and ask any questions they have. This also helps scientists to communicate current findings in an understandable fashion.SciChat works by connecting members of the public with scientists in the areas they are interested in. By searching keywords, the users are matched with corresponding experts and taken to a live chat where they can discuss the topic of interest in a conversational manner.We developed SciChat as a javascript-based web application without any dependency on a back-end. For our app we needed a database to store our users base as well as a user-authentication system. We used Firebase for that purpose which provides a fully functional API with all backend resources SciChat requires. The chat client module of our app has been implemented using the PeerJS library, which provides a rich API for achieving efficient WebRTC p2p chat communication through a mediator server provided by PeerJS.We’d like to display recommended papers (relevant to the selected area of interest) to the user if they are waiting to be connected to another member, however we had some challenges using the APIs of scientific journals, and so plan to implement this feature in future.Creating a functioning prototype of our idea within the timeframe of 24 hours. Implementing a chat interface that pairs users based on similar interests/research fields via tags.We can do a lot of stuff in 24 hours!
The biologists in the group learned to code in html, javascript and the basic structure of creating a website.To refine the current website, we need to improve upon usability as well as implement numerous extra features we did not have time to integrate.
In addition to public-to-academic communication, we hope to add a scientist-to-scientist communication to the platform. Scientists would be able to display a profile including information about their research along with links to publications and professional websites. 
We would also like to add a reputation system where academics can rate the engagement of the user they chatted with, and vice versa. This will allow for a more sophisticated pairing algorithm in the future. We also hope this will further incentivise the use of the platform.
There are several ways in which data generated may be used, such as understanding trending topics and creating user statistics (average rating, number of chats)Hack Cambridge RecurseOmar Wagih

We came up with a fun and social application that utilised some of these tools.SoundSparrow is a fun and social application designed to let people interact through music. Everyone has a unique tune that is augmented based on your mood! Mash with nearby sparrows to create unique new tunes by mixing the music.SoundSparrow generates a persistent UUID for each phone and uses this to seed a random number generator. In turn, this is used to algorithmically generate a song. We change musical elements based on the emotion of the user; this is done using the Microsoft Cognitive Services emotion module and sending an image taken by the user. We broadcast GAP advertising packets that contain the UUID and emotion of each user; these are picked up by all other devices and the songs are merged and played. Azure was used in order to rapidly host the photos for emotive analysis.Working with Android can be challenging at times, an example can be seen when attempting to implement the Bluetooth algorithm. An advertising packet can only fit 31 bytes of user data, and despite the lightweight mentality taken when considering the design, this created difficulty when deciding what information to send.Working on separate key areas of the project independently and subsequently being able to seamlessly merge the components together. Being able to communicate in both directions in real time between multiple Android devices through Bluetooth.We learned a lot about the mechanics of Android development, and now know common mistakes to avoid in future. Also gained knowledge of development in all aspects of the application using brand new tools; such as Azure and Microsoft APIs.Next would be to take the social aspects to the next level, by sharing user details including social networking sites through the existing communication.

We've got less than an ARM's length of time to our exams, yet we're flooded by the need to keep thinking about what to focus on, and how we would absorb the knowledge into our heads -- how do we push the FRONTIER of our knowledge and what should we study first?But yet, why do we have to be the ones wasting our jet brains on making these decisions?We believe that the tediousness of planning and prioritising what to study, when to study and how study is unnecessary and often messy. We should be spending our time on the things that matter - learning with greater depth or spending quality time with our friends.Improvable is a platform which takes care of this for you - it learns about you as you learn about the world. It provides you with practice questions for your exams and knows what you are good at and bad at, adapting to your abilities and reinforcing the concepts you have freshly learnt through personalised notifications.But what good is that in a boring interface? Improvable is more than a platform - it's a lively and lovely chat bot and personalised learning buddy. It tells jokes, keeps track of your learning and accelerates your learning just for you!Within each session, users will be available to review their performances by sharing, rating and comparing their statistics against the past, or their friends. Scoring is based on each session and provides a dynamic, interactive and accurate metric for fast and motivating feedback.Distilling the ethos of every inspiring teacher-pupil relationship was at the heart of Improvable. From then, we've tessellated, out, creating complex ORIGAMI folds, adding humour and personality to solid facts whilst keeping the interface fresh, crisp and as sharp as an ARGON bulb. Each of the four stages has been carefully crafted before being PUSHed to fulfil the gestalt of what learning can be. Using a powerful MICROSOFT azure server, Improvable was designed to be fast and responsive, giving the student full responsibility and MANpower over the STUDIO of study.We changed our ideas midway after realising that creating a learning buddy would be much more interactive and intuitive than our initial straight-laced platform, and had to quickly adjust our mindset and code. What better way would there be than for the student to forge their own path of discovery of learning?We wanted to allow the writer free reign over the product, with natural language of their own - this proved to be a challenge that needed pure PUSHERS to overcome in pure javascript.Our learning buddy has spread joy and knowledge to the people around us. We've relished the opportunity to imbue each of our own contrasting personalities into Improvable, ensuring that there's something for everybody.Our first bot built for most of us, and definitely lots more about DirectLine and the Microsoft Azure APIs for bots and AI. Was an accelerated 24 hours of learning for all of us! Seeing, interacting and constantly developing the bot was a rewarding experience for all, and hopefully the first of many similar ones to come.Getting it out to students, teachers and users everywhere! 
We understand that not every student can afford to have personalised feedback from teachers and private tutors all the time - why not make such a service accessible to all students just through a click of a button?Hack Cambridge RecurseI designed the architecture of the service and created the structure and communication of the back-end, passing queries into the bot and outputting the result. Semantic intent was achieved using NLP, which was optimised for speed.I made a bot that teaches Math and Physics!I worked on creating the algorithm for adaptive content and a back-end scoring system using a probabilistic model. Also on integration of the bot into the android app using the Direct Line API.I worked on the Front End of the Android app, integrating Google Sign-In and Profiles, creating a messaging facility and getting started on the data visualisation. I helped to overcome the concurrency issues and problems with integrating the Direct Line API - that was tricky!dyth

It can offer the most valuable insight if the images all include the same audience at different moments in a presentation.Using the online resources published by Microsoft (e.g. documentation and references of the Emotion API) and Visual Studio, we build a simple Windows Form Application, consisting of two forms, one of which contains the form for uploading images, while the other one displays the results.One of the biggest challenges we encountered was making the different pieces of the application fall into place. While one of us tried to build the UI, someone else explored how to make use of the Emotion API and the other one worked on converting the resulting JSON into a useful format for further processing.Taking into account our inexperience and the amount of time we spent researching online the abilities of the tools we planned to use, getting the application to work without crashing might be regarded as an accomplishment itself. Also, we would say that we worked quite well as a team, learned new things and enjoyed ourselves.We now know how to make use of the Cognitive Services API, how to convert the JSON into the wanted form and how to integrate these pieces into an Windows Forms Application.We will definitely try to enhance the user interface and offer a more in-depth analysis of the results given by the Emotion API and we are considering offering advice to our users as to how to hone their public speaking skills.Hack Cambridge RecurseI worked on the backend, by creating the connection with Microsoft Cognitive Services.

However, test sticks covered with chemicals that change color  depending on the properties of the water (like the famous Litmus test for the ph-value) are very cheap to produce and easy to use. However, reading out the correct values can be a bit tricky and since many people actually own smartphones anyway we wanted to come up with a way to combine the two.Our App automates the process of reading out the values from the color coding of a mock up test stick. Just focus with your camera and the app will tell you the ph-value associated with the sample you provided.We used OpenCv in C++ for the technical part of the app. First we normalize the input image (similar to what happens when you scan QR codes). This means that even slightly tilted or rotated input works fine with the algorithm (most of the time :P). As the next step we extract the color values from the normalized image by averaging over certain areas.We have stored a table containing color codes for various chemicals and ph values, so that then we are able to perform a simple optimization in order to find the ph value that matches the theoretical data best.The app itself is written in a mix of Swift 3 (for the interface) and ObjectiveC (to communicate with our C++ code).Neither of us had experience in mobile development, so getting to grips with Swift and ObjectiveC was a struggle.

This year, we carried on the theme of exploring how human interaction with computers will change in the future.Its a 3 - dimensional IDE which incorporates mouseless interaction.We used an Oculus Rift and a Leap Motion device.We did everything in java. We used the JOGL library to communicate directly to an Oculus Rift. We also, used the jovr library to translate java into OpenGL. Thankfully the interaction between the leap motion device was also done in java.A LOT of challenges were overcome. First, the Oculus Rift demands a lot of graphical processing power. Out of three laptops we could only run it on a mac. Oculus has dropped all support for mac users which meant we could only run the Oculus on very old drivers. Hence, documentation was rather hard to come by. In addition to this, since we were running older drivers we could not take advantage of easier VR techniques such as WebVr. Hence, we were forced to use JOGL bindings to write directly to the oculus rift display and JOVR to read the IMU data from Oculus.  Thus, we have completed a vr project in java!I think the most important thing is - we did it ! We've had this idea for a very long time and we ran into so many problems. At certain points it looked as if the idea was achievable and we would be left with partial bits of code . However, we never ever gave up and tried absolutely everything. To incorporate the leap motion as well, is an added bonus since it enhances the unique property of our project.Vr requires a lot of processing power  and where there's a will there's a way ! Seriously, having to use the Oculus where there is no support and being forced to use technology we weren't used to was an absolute pain! But we regret nothing because we achieved an amazing product in the end.V-de is a working concept that has the potential to redefine the relationship between humans and computers. So far it's and IDE for developers. Imagine if you could see the effects of your code whilst you are coding. All achievable in the Oculus.

Yet despite the huge uptake, there remains a lack of support for the visually impaired. We believe that the user experience of the visually impaired would be greatly enhanced by providing feedback through facial recognition and interpretation of the expressions of the people they are talking to.eMotion aims to address the lack of support for the visually impaired by harnessing a Microsoft Cognitive API to provide real-time information on facial expressions during a video call. The API interprets a still image of the video call and calculates the likelihood of different emotions. A customisable sound-effect is then played to inform the user of the most likely emotion.The peer2peer connection is established and maintained using WebRTC, Node.js, and socket.io. Video streams are embedded in the html code using Javascript, which also powers the back-end.A key issue was that domains that we created were unable to stream video because the location was not considered secure enough. Socket.io is very hard to implement on cloud systems. The Microsoft API was incredibly useful, but involved a steep learning curve.We are proud of how quickly we were able to adapt to challenges outside of our usual comfort zones by trying out new technologies and languages.Coming from a wide variety of backgrounds, we were each able to learn a great deal about each other's skillsets.Hack Cambridge RecurseI worked on our version of the Emotion-API and helped with css and html.ErmeHarrier

Conventional literature searches provide the publications that intersect some subspace, usually defined by a keywords. More recent social media/bot approaches try to interpret the subspace the user is familiar with and suggest publications that exist at or just outside the boundary of this familiarity.

Our service provides a means of bridging between the subspace of knowledge which the user knows and their search subspace. This is done by presenting the minimum necessary publications required for the user to traverse between these subsapces.Publication subspace coverage is approximated as nodes and the hyperspace is projected onto a network with distances between nodes as approximations to the distances within the hyperspace.These distance estimates are an aggregations of several factors including whether the papers are citation/reference connected (first degree connection), how many shared cited/referencing papers they have (second degree connections) and overlap of keywords. More could include text analysis of abstract/full text analysis; author input; experint input; user input or others.A shortest path is found on a network of unity weight edges for distances below a threshold and weights penalised above unity for distances above the threshold. This threshold is to model the users ability to move outside his field of knowledge. So papers they find comfortable learning are included but papers that they would find challeneging are penalised.Hack Cambridge RecurseJeremy Minton

I also wanted a method of posting to Instagram through a different platform (not only restricted to my IPhone Instagram App).InstaVision is a web application that allows users to upload a photo, automatically generate hash tags with the click of a button and post the photo to their Instagram account.I used Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision API to analyse the uploaded image and return a list of keywords which are converted into hashtags that are inserted into the caption.
I built the back-end using PHP and various third party APIs such as Imgur API for uploading an image to cloud temporarily and NXS API for posting to Instagram.
For the front-end, I used Javascript/JQuery and AJAX for submitting form data to the API endpoint and handling image uploads, and I used HTML/CSS and the Bootstrap framework for the basic user interface.I learnt a lot about the Microsoft Cognitive Services and it's various APIs and how to utilise them in PHP. I also learnt how to handle file uploads and send requests to the API using AJAX.Hack Cambridge RecurseI worked on the project on my ownBrian Min

Cristian Axenie, Simeon Kostadinov, Mark MathewsIt has been estimated that 33% of people age 65 will fall. At around 80, that increases to 50%. In
case of a fall, seniors who receive help within an hour have a better rate of survival and, the faster
help arrives, the less likely an injury will lead to hospitalization or the need to move into a long-term
care facility. In such cases fast visual detection of abnormal motion patterns is crucial.In this project we propose the use of a novel embedded Dynamic Vision Sensor (eDVS) for the task of classifying falls. Opposite from
standard cameras which provide a time sequenced stream of frames, the eDVS provides only relative
changes in a scene, given by individual events at the pixel level. Using this different encoding scheme
the eDVS brings advantages over standard cameras. First, there is no redundancy in the data received
from the sensor, only changes are reported. Second, as only events are considered the eDVS data rate is
high. Third, the power consumption of the overall system is small, as just a low-end microcontroller is
used to fetch events from the sensor and can ultimately run for long time periods in a battery powered
setup. This project investigates how can we exploit the eDVS fast response time and low-redundancy
in making decisions about elderly motion.The computation backend will be realized with a neural network classificator to detect fall and filter outliers. The data will
be provided from 2 stimuli (blinking LEDs at different frequencies) and will represent the actual position of the person wearing them.
The changes in position of the stimuli will encode the possible positions corresponding to falls or normal cases.We will use Microsoft Azure ML Studio to implement a MLP binary classifier for the 4 (2 stimuli x 2 Cartesian coordinates - (x,y) in the field of view) dimensional input. We labelled the data with Fall (F) and No Fall (NF).Hack Cambridge RecurseCristian Axenie

You enter an event title, a start and stop time for tracking. The app will then run in the background of your device for the chosen time.

Allowing you to join or create a team that will give you the top hackathon experience.The bot collects information about each user when they join the Slack group, taking information from their Github and Devpost accounts, as well as mentor and team statuses.By talking to the Cam Bot on the Slack account you can find out more about individual users and get lists of mentors or people looking for a team (which you can filter depending on any language requirements).When you ask about a specific user the Cam Bot will send you screenshots of the user's Github and Devpost pages, their team and mentor statuses, the languages they know, and links to their Github, Devpost and LinkedIn account. You can ask the bot for a list of mentors or people looking for a team, which you can then explore individually in  more detail. You can also update your team status, and view your profile.We are running two Node.js servers that exchange data via a REST API.One is used to control the chatbot itself and manage chat session data. It uses the Microsoft Bot Framework, which allows us to deploy our bot to several platforms easily - we currently have Slack and Facebook Messenger integration (although the primary use should be via Slack).Our second server manages user profiles, authentication, user OAuth tokens for 3rd party API integrations, and handles rendering of user image-dashboards - we are using a headless WebKit, PhantomJS, to render screenshots of new users' GitHub and Devpost previews. It later serves these assets for the chatbot controller to use them.
Here we also handle team formations and persist user data.The Cam Bot can already be used in any Slack group, as long as the Slack admin adds Cam Bot to the group.

Make informed decisions backed by your data!Input data via interactive chatbotintuitive data presentation for analysisWe noticed that minor medical conditions often are hard to pin down. Examples include skin irritation, indigestion, or migraine. To make matters worse, the causes for such symptoms are unique to each person. Therefore, we set out on a simple and yet challenging task to create personalised data tracking that is accessible to everyone.In addition, we realised that the same platform can be used to make informed decisions about our lives. In my personal dataset that was uploaded to the server we saw that productivity suffers from alcohol. (More subtile correlations were excluded for privacy reasons)Briefly, it interactively collects users data via chat-bots (slack/facebook/skype) and present analysed data back to the users. The user can pick the objectives he is interested in and our server picks the most important questions to ask. When there is enough data, the platform suggests an informed decision.We started off by brainstorming ideas through the email conversation, which was started by the organising team. Hence, we already knew what we wanted to do when we arrived – some conceptual design was followed by flowcharts and the build began. With 2-4 hours of sleep, the team was up and running for most of the time. The time was well spent and we have succeeded to make an MVP!We encountered 3 main challenges : the Bot itself is stateless, and integrating State into such a complex system makes for a very sensitive process of compile-run-debug, which often times turned frustrating. Debugging seemed somewhat difficult since the system seemed to behave differently locally and on azure, so we needed to deploy and use the bot itself to get messages. The second problem was getting the Scala web back-end to connect to SQL Server, which was incredibly difficult (had to basically write an entire Java wrapper library) due to poor compatibility between Scala and JDBC. Our last problem was not getting the Amazon Alexa to work, which we attribute to the fact that the bot turned out to be a lot more complex to build than we had thought and so we ran out of time.Add security layers, make it fully scalable, add dynamic NLP using MS Cog Services.

We live in a world where walls are built while people leave their homes, seeking for help. Our endeavour was to model the migration of individuals in a fictional universe, in order to showcase the dynamic way in which people immigrate, and how this impacts the population and living standards in each country. This kind of simulation would be the answer to many ""What if...?"" questions governments, scientists or economists could ask. These answers would not only allow proactive measures to be taken, but could save lives.Using SpatialOS, we have built a large scale simulation of migration in the magical World of Warcraft. The current model consists of 10 countries between which thousands of people migrate. The phenomenon is based on both personal and regional characteristics, each movement having a certain probability of occurring at any given time. The model is flexible and permits simulation based on customizable parameters, making it a useful tool for governments which want to be prepared for an influx of immigrants, or in case of natural disasters or even war. Or if somebody decides to build a wall.We built the project using C# and integrating the map and movement of people in unity, and used SpatialOS to run the simulation at large scale. Starting from a simple model of random migration, we then used probability theory and population dynamics to mathematically describe the phenomenon.Learning the structure and functionality of SpatialOS and integrating it with unity were two of the major challenges we faced. Finding a relatively simple mathematical model to realistically describe immigration was also a challenging task.We learned how to use SpatiolOS and integrate it with unity. Even though the learning process took a lot of time and we faced a lot of challenges, we managed to fix many of the bugs and to deliver a functional product.The hackathon has been an invaluable learning experience, as we started from scratch with SpatialOS and spent the first few hours of the hackathon learning its structure, functionality and particularities. We also read various research papers on immigration, population dynamics and migration modeling. Besides, we improved our knowledge of C# and learned unity.The next important steps are building larger maps and modeling more parameters which determine the probability of migration. By introducing these features, we will increase the flexibility of the platform, making it able to simulate migration at continent and even global level.

This is vital in a highly secure environment to avoid unauthorised access to data.Other potential applications:
We can see this being applied in areas where full attention of the user is required for high security reasons, such as in the following two use cases:Used a popular open-source project, Boss Sensor as inspiration to use face recognition via deep learning, training on examples of faces. The deep learning is performed by using Tensor flow and Keras. To get the video feed, we're using OpenCV.-- Using Tensor flow and Keras for deep learning. A huge number of training examples are required. Therefore, it is not as accurate yet as we'd like it to be. 
-- Getting OpenCV installed on a mac. This was a nightmare.-- Able to differentiate between different faces as opposed to just traditional face detection. This is able to recognise different faces for example the face of an authorised user vs. an unauthorised user.We've learned how to use Tensor flow for deep learning. We also learned about feature recognition and image manipulation.We would like to automate the learning process of the algorithm. Currently, we have to manually capture images and train the algorithm. Automating this process would mean a larger training dataset, resulting in higher accuracy.Hack Cambridge RecurseArgha Sarkar

However, it's our first experience in game development, therefore we decided to create a game with a simplistic art style, similar to limbo. We wanted to try and recreate an atmospheric and somewhat creepy experience that Limbo was able to capture. At the same time, we understood that our ambition to create such a game in just three hours, with our limited experience, was a long shot! Hence we were also inspired by games such as 'The Binding of Isaac' created in game-jams of their own in extremely short time frames. This resulted in us learning how to use 'gamemaker' as a game engine and 'GIMP' for level design. The short time frame allowed us to appreciate the task to create quality games. Whilst under such time constraints we were unable to include an initial key feature of ours which was to use sophisticated light mechanics. Unfortunately, our constraints didn't allow us enough time to learn how to use open GL shaders. However, despite this, we were still happy to create a functional prototype of our initial level. We managed to design the level and character externally and then implement the separate code we wrote in gamemaker.R.U. Hacking? Mini Hack!James Riley

Check-in rules vary from airline to airline, and depending on where you go, so it's nice to have one place to ask.We ask the user for a flight number, and then send a series of API calls to the FlightAware interface. This lets us know where the flight is going, coming from, what airline it is, etc. With the origin and destination, we class the flight as European, Domestic, or International. We then lookup what the baggage and check-in rules are for this airline, for this type of flight. We also determine how long it would take to get to the airport by the user's preferred method, using the Google Maps Directions API.With this and the check-in information, we then determine when the user should leave home. The user can then ask follow-up questions about their bag allowance, and whether meals are served onboard, which will then be answered.It works. Miraculously.Alexa is really limited in terms of understanding speech. You need to template every conceivable way someone could phrase the question, there is no built-in aliasing.In the Alexa skills API there is no way to retrieve the location of the user, not even the address hardcoded into the Alexa account. These details are exposed to only a small set of industry API users, such as Uber, granting an unfair competitive advantage.Apple are dicks. When charging a mobile device through a Macbook, they reduce the charge amperage for any non-Apple device.

Use Safety App to show you the safest way home in Durham.HeatmapGiven recent events, we feel it is important for Durham students to find their way home safely after a night out. With the release of lots of data by Durham County Council, we thought this provided an opportunity to improve the safety of students in Durham.After a heavy night out, it's important to get home safe. This means following lit streets - and, particularly in Durham - staying away from the river, and being conscious of traffic. Get Home Safe combines the familiarity and ubiquity of Google Maps with never-before-seen data points from Durham County Council to show clubbers the safest route home after a night out.
Get Home Safe highlights the density of streetlights and traffic across County Durham to visually indicate to the user the safest path through the city.Get Home Safe is a web app using node.js and MySQL on the backend, and revolves largely around the free Google Maps API on the frontend. Each team member took care of separate parts of the project, including developing the backend, populating the database, interpreting and visualising the data, and taking care of the front end. 
Our database contains approximately 80,000 entries - each representing the coordinates of a street light in County Durham. Upon loading the web app, the backend dynamically sends the required entries to the user, depending on their map viewport.One of the initial challenges was converting the data into a usable format. The coordinates had to be bulk converted from 'easting and northing' format to 'longitude and latitude', which is no small task when there are 80,000 points to convert! We then had to load these into the database, which proved to be difficult due to the sheer number of entries.
Another idea we had was to reduce the number of data points with a clustering algorithm. However, due to time constraints, it proved unfeasible to comprehend all the complex modules and techniques that would be required.
We attempted to map each data point to a street - this in itself proved difficult due to the method by which Google Maps stores information about its streets and the sheer processing power this would require.
We used Google's API to plot lines on the roads that were lit (i.e. that had street lights on them), and this work (although incomplete) can be seen on the Lit Roads page.Our interface is user friendly, responsive and well optimised. Having a nearly finished - and, crucially, usable - product in such a short space of time is something to be proud of, and we feel that our product could be tweaked and released as a commercial app. 
The map data is surprisingly responsive - by dynamically loading the data points that are needed and then using Google's API to convert this to a heatmap means the work done by the browser is far less than that if we were to load all 80,000 data points into the webpage.Using Git is something many of us had not experienced before, but now we feel we have a certain level of ability and are able to use it in future projects.
node.js runs the backend of our project, and we have learnt more about making a 'static' site using Express.
We learnt adaptable skills in how to take third party APIs and put these together to realise a complete idea.The plan is to further develop the Lit Roads idea, to best show the user the safest route home. We could also further optimise the site to work on small mobile devices. 
We could even use more data from other county councils to expand our reach, or to include other Durham data such as footfall, and combine all this to find even safer routes home.DurHackI attempted to use a clustering algorithm to condense data. I formalized the use of the google maps api using javascript.AXGreenen

That's where our inspiration comes from.Our native android app takes card machine data from across the web, and plots on a map whether nearby restaurants and shops in Durham take card. It also plots nearby ATM machines, so you can easily spot where your closest cashpoint is. It keeps itself up to date by collecting user feedback.We used python as a server, also to scrape the data that we need from the web. The frontend is built in react-native.The biggest challenge we ran into was collecting the data. This kind of application hasn't been done before, so the data was difficult to collect. The solution was to scrape from LINK (for ATM data), as well as American Express credit card locater. This means that not every shop/restaurant is covered. This is why we came up with the idea of crowd-sourcing. As you can see from the app, the majority are covered. However, once people start using it, the idea is that the database will just keep growing and growing.Producing an app like no other. This is something that is not in the market, and highly useful on a day to day basis.We spent a lot of time setting up our environments, so having stuff installed pre-hack is a must. Also, we overestimated how much data was out there. However, our workarounds to these problems have contributed to a successful hack.We're adding support for Apple/Android pay, as well as more debit cards.

Meaning that every night many students very far from home are strander, drunk, cold and incapable of looking after themselves after a night out. Yet they still make the arduous journey in the middle of the night intoxicated back to their colleges. This can be especially dangerous if you have to go through dark wooded areas of if you are by yourself.Many times I have had to take my friends home on a 30minute walk or just stumbled across collapsed men and women in the street who were too drunk to go home. The student union had an answer to this. A night bus, it would pick you up no matter where you are and take you home for £2. Problem is that is not advertised well (ask anyone if they know what it is, they likely won't - the number is hidden on a 95 page document), notoriously difficult to get hold of and not very user friendly to use (you have to describe where you are to the driver over the phone = nightmare). Factor in the fact that your drunk and you can see why students don't use this excellent service and put themselves at risk by going home.The night bus is the safe way for lone students to get around Durham safely:When studying late in the library to get home
To get to and from the train station late at night
To travel between colleges
To get to or from late bars and nightclubs
You’re visiting friends
At the cinema or theatreDUber is essentially an SOS get me home now app. Let me set the scene, a student on night out decided that it would be wise to down a bottle of vodka and now needs to head home. He lives in the hill college, half an hour away. He pulls out the app, hits the pick me up button. The nightbus driver is pinged his picture, location and the student is given an ETA. The driver and the student both get eachothers numbers and can contact eachother if the student or driver can't find each other. The App handles the payment and whether the student paid. We get all the data from CIS so the driver and the union know exactly who are using the service.The app consists of two major components. An app which the driver and student will use and a PHP REST API. The API scrapes the student data from Durham username and password and handles all the DB operations and provides the endpoints which the app relies on.Operating around the constrains of the universities systems was the only challenge we faced. Trying to get a way to authenticated on Durham's portal using students passwords and username was quite a challenge. (This was omitted from this release due to security concerns, will be work on and put back in at a future date)We have a working app and the API is functional. Although both need refining we have proven that it is feasible and intend on carrying on development on the project and handing it over to the student union.There is a genuine potential here. I have called the nightbus to get many of my friends home. But hardly anyone knows about it. I have seen many people frantically try to ring cab companies or call an actual uber. Only to be disappointed. If they are really really really lucky they will run into a rep that will take them home. But if not they are stranded and if they are in the hill colleges they have a good half hour walk just to get home. We intend on developing this fully and giving it to the union for free. I think this will be especially helpful for freshers and will significantly increase the safety of students.DurHackMaksud Rahman

presentation, data and events related classes! wooooo!I worked on importing map data, by using the google static maps api and a matlab script to edit and improve it. I then worked together with Callum on the Java Map class, that contains the map representation and infection spreading algorithms. Finally I wrote a method to colour code and visualise the infection percentage on the map.I did something to do with events and event manager, also wrote some stories and events. Helped with data conversions. Half of presentation done by me as wellI with Daniel wrote the map class, which simulated virus spread through the population of Durham as time passed and held global city data, and myself wrote the location class which stored location data for landmarks around the city. The virus simulation was quite challenging to get to work convincingly as the wrong balance of variables would mean its spread would grind to a halt. I also cleaned up the people and main classes to make them more easily readable and wrote the event triggers for random encounters.Jordan Craig

It's also inspired by fulfilling the curiosity of Christians who want to know the story behind the song.Scripturally Sound provides scriptural references and topics of the songs used for worship, and the Christian songs that they may listen to on the radio or streaming services. It allows Christians to be more discerning of the music that they listen to.We build an API and admin backend in rails. We built a data import script in Node.js. We build the front end in ES6 Javascript, using the pug templating language.We plan on building the database to be robust, with thousands of songs, and more scriptures per song. We will create an API that would show the lyric to scripture relationship line by line, and create lyric inspired-bible studies for subscribers. Scripturally Sound could potentially be referenced by Christian music artist after their concerts, providing their fans with a biblical resource that allows them to grow deeper spiritually.

We used JavaScript and jQuery to produce the scripts that take in the locations and allow the developers to upload their events. HTML and CSS was used to create the front end, with the help of bootstrap to keep it looking nice.We found that some of the things didn't work as we had initially expected, and we had to work out our own way around them. For example some of the scripts wouldn't upload the correct data to the dialogue boxes, and so we had to find out why this was happening, and fix it.We're proud of being able to work together well as a team to produce the product that we set out to make.Bootstrap was a new feature to all of us in the team, and we had to learn how to work with it to make the project look nice and do what we want it to do.Hack the Holidays 2Rai Ismail

The design of the website was, of course, inspired by the Hack the Holidays 2 counterpart.The main challenge was learning on how to use Spotify's API, especially the process of grabbing the essential data and parsing it. Another difficulty I experienced was with jQuery, where some components refused to cooperate.

(So we completely abandoned that idea).Therefore, we tried to make a MIDI interpreter in Python to convert MIDI audio instruction files into a list of notes and their durations, but we didn't manage to get it working in the time. Our demo involved music flashed onto the Arduino, which is not the most elegant way of communicating with it but we got the speakers working so we wanted to demonstrate that.Also, the sound is really quiet, so we made some hollow boxes that slightly improve the volume.

Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap.When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!""Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ‘ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""Hack the Holidays 2Cathryn Dunicliff

The idea was to create something small and then add to it more and more if we have time. As the result, our project has a lot of small bits that are responsible for different parts of it.It connects to Spotify.com via it's API and plays a song. While the song is on, the app translates some song's data (frequencies, volume) to the website which does some visual effects which depend on the sent data.Our code is 90-95% javascript. It was sort of a challenge for us as we both did not have a lot of experience in js. We picked it on purpose as hackathons are about learning, are not they ?Stay awake for 35 hoursWe managed to split our work so both of us had stuff to do all the time. Also, we are satisfied with the result, it is way better than we expected.Lots of javascript !We plan at least to clean the code. Also, a login page can be made as soon as Spotify allows to play full songs from other websites. By now, a link that contains the version which was submitted on Hack the Holidays 2 is attached.Hack the Holidays 2Worked with Spotify Web API and Web Audio API with JavaScript to get a song from spotify, to analyze the song based on frequency, to get the frequency values and to draw a histogram of the song which changes around 20 times per second. Created an app which searches for a song on spotify and if the song was not found, the user will be notified.Artjoms Gorpincenko

Nexmo is then used to receive incoming calls, and forwards them to our Node app. It records a section of the call and sends it to the ACRCloud music recognition API. It then compares the response with our list of christmas songs, and sends a text-to-speech response using Nexmo.Nexmo has its quirks (but it ultimately pretty great).

(*feature coming soon)I love Game Boys! I own quite a lot of them, and I've been wanting to write a game for one for quite a while. I have this flash cartridge that lets you run whatever you want on the Game Boy.Because I'm really bad at coming up with game ideas, I ended up making something 'useful' instead!It's a todo list that runs on a Game Boy! Because the Game Boy is such a versatile platform, this software is compatible with the original GB, the Color, and all models of the Advance.I used the GBDK - it's a set of compilers and linkers for targeting the Game Boy (and other z80-like processors). The last release was in 2002, and even trying to compile it for Mac was a huge pain. I eventually found some binaries that somebody had uploaded to a forum in 2006 and used them.GBDK has a load of helper functions for doing stuff on the Game Boy. The means rendering text and using cout is pretty simple! But it doesn't have enough helper functions to handle something like displaying a menu. I had to write that myself (and it's horrible).I had all kinds of problems with missing header files. This problem was compounded by the fact that I literally have no idea when it comes to C. The biggest blocker was not being able to clear the screen. The way all the >10 year old docs said it should be done just didn't work. It still doesn't work, and I have no idea why.I got a working rom, and it runs on real hardware! (but not in an emulator for some reason)C isn't all that bad, but it is mostly. I'm motivated to keep learning it and get better, then eventually I'll work on a proper game!I keep reading everywhere that the only way I'm truly going to be able to get fine control over what I want to do is with assembly programming. The docs and tutorials around asm on the Game Boy are actually really good - much better than with GBDK.I really just need to find the time to learn now!PorticodeI learnt how to use GBDK a bit, and why people use higher level languages than C.Scott Street

The tfl bike system charges extra for not parking in the bike after 30 minutes. The purpose of the app is to provide a route to be able to park the bike every 30 mins, avoiding any extra charges.We started by using android studio to create an app using google maps. The next step we took was creating tracking system so that the app knows the current location of the user. We then added configurations so that the user can click to the destination they want to go to. The first major challenge we experienced was creating a JSON parser specifically for tfl’s bike point API. After spending a long time we finally managed. After that we had to fiddle around with the Async settings which delayed us a bit further. We then had to build a second parser for google API so that we could accurately calculate the timings between several points. We then wrote an algorithm that would find the most effective route between a start and end point which also saves money for the user in the process.Biggest takeaway from this project was learning how to write a JSON parser and then using the information to provide live updates and feedback.This can help more people to consider cycling instead of using more polluting methods of transport as they would save money in the process too.Porticodealekseyrozh Rozhnov

You cannot mess around it with and gives very straightforward answers most of the time. So we decided to build a skill for Alexa that allows her to be more informal with users. We called it Nancy because we invoke it by saying ""Alexa, tell Nancy to do something"".Nancy can recite poems, narrate 2 line horror stories, flirt with you and motivate you with inspirational quotes.We are using Amazon Web Services to host a lambda function which does work. Alexa looks for the particular keywords like 'scare', 'motivate', 'flirt' and 'recite'. The keyword is then sent over to our lambda function which uses it query the approriate database (for 'scare' it would query the database containing horror stories, for 'motivate' it would query the database containing motivational quotes...you get the idea). Once a result is received a lambda response is sent back to Alexa which reads out the response. We also have a website dedicated to Nancy which is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and javascript. The website will be pulishedScarping data from the internet was big challenge we had to over come. We had to alter our source code multiple times to scrap the appropriate data from different websties and return JSON data. Configuring Alexa was also  a big challenge due to intermittent drops in WiFi. We spent 4 hours trying to figure out why Alexa would not pick up our skill only to find out that the account was in English US and Alexa was in English UK. Furthermore, due to Amazon's policy, our skill will only be fully downloadable to everybody once it has been reviewed by them.We successfully programmed the Alexa to do what we wanted it to doWe learnt a lot of new things today like how to scrap data from websites and how to work on back end services like AWS. We learnt programming languages like Node.js and python.PorticodeI scraped data for 2 line horror stories and programmed the lambda function to query databases based on keywordsI scraped the data for the programmers flirt jokes and made the logo using Photoshop. I also helped with the HTML and CSS of the web page.I scraped the data for the motivational quotes and made the background image and icons for the landing page.

Our website is supposed to be a  get-away from pressure sort of website. There are literally tons of apps helping people -particularly students be on top of their studies or work, so we thought why not create something to ease the break free process ?! It's actually our first time ever doing web dev so we opted for a template at first, but it took us AGES to tailor every single line of code !! We wanted then to use an api so that when the user chooses one sort of destination, the website connects to google places API to collect information about all nearby attractions matching that destination type. We went through some tutorials and managed to use the API but we could not parse JSON on javascript so it ended up a bit basic! Quite proud of how far we learned though!PorticodeEsraa Dandash

428,Porticode,428,,428,"Quantum Leap Website & GameWhile looking through the hardware that MLH had to offer at the hackathon, we found the Leap Motion. After playing around with the demo functions for a while, we could see that it was an incredibly versatile piece of technology. Inspired by its ability to so closely replicate games such as Sevens and Squash, we wanted to create a virtual version. Because of the sci-fi like aspects of the concept, we decided to go with a space theme for the game.Originally we wanted to create a web app, using Python or Javascript. However, we soon discovered numerous difficulties associated with accessing the data from the Leap Motion over the web. So instead, we decided to use Unity to develop and offline game that could connect straight to the Leap Motion. None of us had ever used Unity before, so we had quite a lot of trouble getting anything off the ground at first. Eventually, we actually started to figure things out, and before any of us knew it, we had a (semi) functioning space-based squash game. Just having the game wasn't enough, I mean, how could anyone play it if it was offline?Well, from our previous attempts to make a web app, we already had some semblance of a web page on which we would have uploaded our game. We decided that instead of abandoning all of that work, we would instead convert it into a landing page, on which people could download the game, as well as see a trailer and behind the scenes photos from our work on Quantum-Leap.Overall, we really had an amazing time working together to create this fun little project. We all learned a whole load of stuff that we would never have really had the chance to even see, much less use and explore for a whole 24 hours - to top it all off, we actually managed to achieve, not one, but 2 different finished products that we are all very proud of.Table 1.PorticodeWorked on the unity and the C# code behind that as well. It was my first time using both Unity and C#.Christa Lafiguera

The idea evolved to incorporating all different services like cab calling, flight booking, and ordering food.The app is only and as much as a chat.

This sector is currently using climate records for decision making processes as planning of maintenance, evaluation of investment operations, design of the plants (power, etc.), planning of the sector, etc. They are not using seasonal forecasts and long term climate change projections (valuable for this long live assets). The main reason for that it this sector requires river flow as the most important Essential climate Variable, and this variable should be generated with hydrological models, that requires a lot of information (land uses, digital elevation model, etc.) However, two projects are providing this information (in demo mode). SWICCA (Service for Water Indicators in Climate Change Adaptation) offers readily available climate-impact data to speed up the workflow in climate-change adaptation of water management across Europe. ECMWF Web Coverage Service (WCS) is delivering 30 day projections. HydroNext will run in a free web portal. It will allow users to enter the location of the plant they wish to study and some basic parameters (power, reservoir capacity, etc.). Combining this information with river flow data adquired online  from SWICCA and WCS it will generate the next information:HydroNext will boost the demand of climate information in Europa, focusing on private sector and actors that don´t make use of climate change projections and seasonal forecast.The business model will be FREEMIUM. A free web portal will allow to generate the consultations indicated previously. Premium services will include computation of hydro cascade systems , study of the sediments, etc.The portal is running. It has been developed using Dwango. Visualizations make use of C3.js.

We wanted to use their data to show that open data creates win-win situations between the public sector, 
the private sector, and civil society. It was our ambition to create a real, value-adding product for 
Reading Buses using ECMWF data.Our model predicts probability of accidents for buses on bus lines in response to weather conditions.
Key data sets we combined included line routes and Claims data from Reading buses alongside Weather 
data from the MARS archive in particular data sets relating to Total Column Ozone, Precipitation, 
Sonw fall and Evaporation.We used data on bus collisions from 2001 to 2016 and ECMWF data from MARS extracted via the python API. 
We started off with exploratory data analysis in R and plotly (included as html).
Models were built in R using generalised linear models with lasso and ridge regression, 
cross-validation for hold-out test and validation datasets, and plots.
We identified the key words of our challege to be “predicting breakdowns”. Following this on a qualitative 
level we brainstormed a series of questions using the S.Mm.A.R.T (specific, Measures, Motivation, Actions, Routes) 
acrynom. Questions we asked included where were major claims occuring? What are the quantities and measures of the Claims? 
Etc. We then identified data sets that we could combine to help us answer these questions and form hypotheses.Cleaning the bus data was challenging, and it would have been nice to get the MARS data directly into R.
However, the python API did a great job in the end! Perhaps we should come back to the dataset and write an
R package implementation of the Web API library?Built a model with an out-of-sample AUC of 0.76! AUC is a measure of predictive accuracy, 
with 0.5 being random and 1 being a perfect prediction. 0.76 indicates a pretty decent result for a real-world, 
large-scale dataset like this. Quite a bit better than we had initially anticipated!Predicting Accidents for Reading Buses""How to extract MARS data via the python API, and how to deal with NetCDF format data in R.
If we could start all over again we would force John to stay with us the weekend ;)
More of his domain expertise on the could have benefited a lot!"" -Laurens""I learnt a lot about how to use data to back up hypotheses. Coming from a strategic background, working alongside data scientists gave me my first taste of hands-on cleaning of data and using data i nreal time to inform (or invalidate) hypotheses."" - Rajesh""Weather dataset can be very varied and correlate to even bus crashes.""  - Gordon""There is so much potential for interdisciplinary collaborations. Everybody had a different background and skills which were all important in getting the analysis done!"" - FionaWe are pretty confident that Reading Buses will be interested in using our model. 
We are handing over code and model, and hope that there will be opportunities to build on this work in the future! 
Other data can be included to improve the model, such as bus operations, special events in Reading, and time of the day. We are interested in learning more about developing this work in the Reading buses innovator programme, testing our work in small scale pilots within Reading buses and working with the Finance, Engineering and Marketing teams to build economic models around our products. We also brainstormed a number of ideas around both the customer experience and acquisition of more customers.Additional Data sets...Expand predictive analytics within Reading Buses...Write an R package for accessing ECMWF data?

It was great getting to know the python API and I was very happy with the results of the model.I enjoyed working with people from different backgrounds, where some of us focused on creating a solution using code while others were concerned with visualising the results and framing a narrative around it!Well done team :)Laurens Geffert

and high emissions across the world, which are driving climate change and
destroying habitats world-over. In order to motivate this, we have developed
a Shiny App which enables the user to input details of their journeys, including
mode of transport, starting location, end destination, and then compare their
consequent carbon footprint with the national average of their home country. By
giving the app the element of comparison, it becomes less of a negative thing
and gains an aspect of improvement and competition.The app has been designed in Shiny App (because none of us have any expertise
in app or website development), using R, using emissions data from the World
Bank for the per capita country averages. We also used World Bank data on
automobile emissions for various brands, models and fuel types and similarly
for buses, trains and aeroplanes. By inputting the start location and end
destination of their journeys, the app calculates the journey distance for the
chosen mode of transport and thereby finds the resulting CO2 emissions.Finally, the app compares the total journey emissions against the national
average, where it can be decided whether the user has beaten their nation or
not.Lack of expertise in app or web development. Different coding language expertise.The variety of parameters choosable in the app. For example, when travelling by car,
the user is able to specify brand, model type, year, fuel type... and more!How to use Shiny App and calculate carbon emissions for almost any journey, via
various modes of transport.Ideally, we would also like to include calculations of the CO2 emissions
resulting from household gas and electricity usage and factors concerning waste
and food miles, in order to get a complete picture. It would also have been good
to make an actual app or game, for nicer user interfacing.#OpenDataHack @ECMWF - Beyond weather: explore creative uses of open dataJoe Wallwork

For this reason, this app will take your weather preferences as filters first, and then find suitable cities for you to visit.Holideal will be in charge of suggesting you the best holiday given specific parametersThe flask Web-Server serves requests coming from the Web-app, ios app, and android app in an easier to digest format than ECMWF.The web interface will allow you to use Holideal in a tinder-like fashion, by specifying weather parameteres such as surface temperature, cloud coverage, sea temperature, and other parameters. Once these are set, the user is presented a restricted dataset that fits his filters. Then you get the chance reject or accept locations. Rejected ones will not be shown to the user again, while accepted ones will be able to be viewed later on a separate page to review his/her choices.The mobile interfaces (ios and android) will also serve the same functionality, allowing the user to swipe choices left (reject) and right (accept).We used Flask for the Web-app interface, as well as an api
React Native used for both iOS, and AndroidWe found the dataset fairly difficult to get used to. For this reason, we decided to serve requests as part of our Flask server
The fact that we were developing for 3 platforms was also fairly difficult and in retrospect, quite ambitious
Interacting Flask with javascript is not the most pleasant experience.Time constrained completion of tasks that we've never touched before (API, ECMWF, etc)

This is a variation on that, but with a first-person viewpoint and in a 3D environment.It is version of snake where 2 players compete to be the last one standing in a walled area. When a player hits a wall, they lose a unit of their length until they ""die"". Players gain units of length by eating apples and can obtain a temporary speed boost power-up. This is advantageous as bumping into the other player's head causes them to lose units of length in their snake - however this collision also causes you to lose a unit. The game ends when one of the players loses all of their length.We used the engine Unity and the language C# to develop this game.There were problems with getting the chain of spheres representing the snake to move together smoothly, but the problems were fixed relatively easily. Another issue was typing errors in the code, which cost a lot of time for something very simple. Another significant challenge was the time pressure. We had a lot of ideas we wanted to put into this, but unfortunately we ran out of time to complete them.We are proud of what we managed to do in this time and are quite happy with how it looks given our lack of design experience.We learnt how to actually develop games using the Unity engine and about writing algorithms for a basic AI for the computer to play instead of another human player.We were planning to add a computer controlled snake who avoids obstacles and managed to complete a possible algorithm, however we ran out of time to implement this into the game. We also planned to include in-game menus and a scoring system. We are planning to port this for use on VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift.Hackers at Cambridge Game GigJason Joykutty

Eventually, we became fed up with constantly queueing songs for others, and decided to build roombox, a simple room-based queueing system for Spotify.roombox allows users to create password-protected rooms, which in turn creates a playlist in their Spotify account. Other people can then join that room and queue songs into that playlist - the idea being that Spotify plays through whatever has been queued in order, removing the need for someone to oversee the music.For the backend, we used Flask - a powerful template-driven Python web framework designed with modularity and scalability in mind. This allowed us to build roombox up from just a home page without really needing to modify our existing code. This definitely made the development process go a little more smoothly, as well as providing a lot of useful inbuilt stuff.For the frontend, we elected to use a framework called MaterializeCSS - this was perfect for a variety of reasons:Honestly, the development went quite smoothly all things considered. We ran into an issue where a bug in our code caused the database into an odd state, resulting in errors when performing queries - because we weren't storing any valuable data at that stage in development, we could work around the problem by deleting the database until we fixed the bug. In general, we found that database management was the most difficult part of the project to implement. Aside from that, there were no show-stopping issues, and we were able to get roombox finished relatively quickly.Developing roombox taught us a lot about front-end development more than anything; making sure the site was straightforward, ensuring the next steps were obvious, et cetera. We found that a lot of our time was spent rearranging things on the frontend to remove unnecessary steps, and fixing usability issues with the layout (like putting the search bar above the queue, where previously it was below and could end up off-screen). Additionally, it was nice to learn how the Spotify Web API works, and we learned a lot about how to make requests (and parse the response) using the popular requests library available on pip.We have thrown around the idea of preparing roombox for public use - the idea seems to be popular with people who have had it demonstrated to them, and the site is pretty close to being ready for public consumption - we just need to finish implementing little ""polish"" things (like auto playlist deletion after a given time, and the ability for the host to delete things from the queue).HackNotts 2016worked mostly on frontend stuff and some serverside (writing the init script for the Flask server, etc.)worked on backend, including authorisation and communication with Spotify API and database managementToby Jones

Initially, we planned on using Alexa to note down milestones and events, but as this later became less of an option, APIs were suggested to us.It acts to help hackathon attendees document tweets, commits, and milestones, and presents these in a final summary table.We built the frontend using core HTML initially, neglecting to style the website until core functionality was in place. We also endeavoured to implement the Twitter and GitHub APIs. We allowed users to store what they wanted to document in MongoDB, and endeavoured to parse Twitter and GitHub data into this database too.Making sense of both the Twitter API and GitHub API were a challenge. Parsing the Twitter data was also a nightmare! We had no previous experience using these APIs. Interfacing between PHP and HTML proved a challenge, since the website was very heavy on both reading and writing database data.We are proud of making the APIs work and integrating all our work together! We believe that with a quick and easy setup, this could be a tool that we all use during hackathons.We learned about new APIs, building forms, and using databases. In particular, Simon began to understand PHP, and while Darren had experience in this before, he learned about the most effective ways to use database data in a website.Integrate more APIs into Hacker Tracker to make it a stronger platform for many people use it as a platform to document their previous hackathons! It also has social network potential.HackNotts 2016I built the server-side backend of this website in PHP and the ability to store user data submitted in a MongoDB database. Whilst I had some experience working with MongoDB and PHP before, linking the two technologies together was unfamiliar territory which made the whole experience rather challenging. Having said that, I have learnt lots of new things such as the MongoDB PHP drivers, browser sessions, Composer and the Twitter API.Tzen Szen Toh

479,HackNotts 2016,479,,479,"Banking made for the 21st centuryWe saw what you could do with Alexa and seeing the talk by Capital One made it obvious to us. We wanted to see the future and the only way to do that is by inventing it.We built a skill for Alexa using Python as our backend and flask-ask to interact with and create the skill for Alexa. You can call commands such as ""Alexa, show me my balance in Retirement"", ""Alexa ask banking to show me my financial report"", ""Alexa ask banking to remind me that I owe John £10"", and ""Alexa ask banking to buy me a chicken using account Credit Card""We built this over a 24 hour hackathon using Flask-ask, Python, Json and Requests. 
Arron and I worked on the backend side using the Capital One API. Ollie and Chris worked on the Alexa front end.The Alexa API regularly timed out due to poor wifi or other issues. To overcome this we set up a mobile hotspot to circumnavigate the bad internet.Making Alexa understand and respond to requests made by humans. This was one of the more challenging aspects, despite the Alexa API supporting this. Because of the issues we had with the API it was difficult for us to develop a basic working Alexa application fast.We learned how to use object orientated design within Python and how to effectively work with the Alexa and Capital One API.Since Capital One only have a hackathon API we might not be able to develop much on it, however, the future of banking is clearly to bring it into the home and to use IOT devices such as Amazon Echo/Dot and we are glad to have been at the edge of technology.Thanks to some good comments from Capital One, we will be continuing this project.HackNotts 2016I worked on the backend with Arron, I created functions which acted like API following the Unix Philosophy to allow the Alexa team to easily implement the capital one functions in their programs. Specifically I created:
How much you owe someone and the ability to owe someone an amountAbility to find a users account using natural language processing which allowed the user to search for ""savings account"", ""ID: 5f9568fmae"", ""account with balance £500"" or any other parameters that are unique to the account.Ability to purchase products from sellers that support capital oneCreate a financial reportWorked with Brandon on processing the nessie API and making the endpoints for Alexa.Specifically on the OOP aspect of the system. Making the Bills, Account, and Transfers Classes. Parsing multiple accounts from Nessie, and converting that into a list of objects making it easier for both the backend and front end to work multiple pieces of data.Actually set up the Alexa. Very proud of it. aMEIzing.I was working with the Amazon Alexa API and integrating the backend Python functions that Aaron and Brandon worked on with the Alexa Christos set up. I created the utterances and intents that forwarded commands given to Alexa to the appropriate python functions that formatted responses, and then sent those responses back to Alexa.Brandon Skerritt

Pebble was a new gadget for most of the team and we wanted to explore what we could do with it.HotPebble is made up of 3 simple utilities function.Use Cases:There are two main components to this project, the client-side pebble application and the server scripts to handle client data. The client-side pebble application is built in pure C, the highest level language in the world ;). The server scripts are built in Python and caters separately to both macOS and Windows. The macOS scripts uses Python libraries such as pyautogui and pynput, whereas the Windows scripts uses the win32api.The pebble app collects accelerometer data and performs on-device processing to eliminate jitter and smoothen out spikes in orientation values. The app then pipes the data via Bluetooth serial to a server listening on a laptop, which interprets the data to perform the various commands that HotPebble is capable of. This includes scrolling the active window, sending media keys such as Play/Stop, Next/Previous Track, volume control and simple presentation shortcuts.It was a difficult process to connect pebble applications to non-mobile devices as there was no official API support for direct connection. We had to rely on an external Python library (libpebble2) to accomplish it. The documentation was not very extensive and not much resources/examples were available online. Therefore, we had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to implement the functionalities that we desire.It was our first hackathon together as a team even though we had known each other for more than a year. It was an amazing experience as we got to learn about each other better.We are super proud to have completed what we had set out to do. It will definitely be a memorable time and a start for many more great hackathon experiences to come.Learning to work well in a team. Finding workarounds to technical obstacles that we face.

484,OxfordHack,484,,484,"Automatically generating instrumental music for given lyricsLots of people are creative enough to write awesome lyrics, but they lack the musical knowledge to create songs with them. What if we had a program to generate a good song depending on the text input?
That's exactly what AutoDJ does.Using Microsoft's Text Analysis API from Cognitive Services, we analyse the key-phrases of the input text given by the user. We also look if it is happy / sad, using the sentiment analysis feature of the API. 
We compare the resulted features against a large collection of song lyrics, using the cosine similarity measure. The first few best matches are then fed into a Restricted Boltzmann Machine algorithm that generates a new song from them.First we downloaded a large number of popular songs from YouTube (the instrumentals only) and their lyrics separately from different websites. 
Then we have a script that calls Microsoft's Text Analysis API and gets the key phrases for the user input, and compares it using the cosine similarity measure with the key phrases from all the lyrics downloaded.
We take the instrumental songs of the best matches (encoded as .mid) and feed them into the neural network that generates a new .mid with similar sounding.It's very hard to generate new music, as this is a cutting-edge current research topic.
It is also very hard (and thus unreliable) to convert mp3s into midis. We had some troubles doing that, and even now it's not too accurate.
Of course we also had the usual issues with permissions, dependencies, etc., but who doesn't have those ?Actually managing to complete a pipeline user -> algorithm -> result -> user.Quite a lot. Mostly about neural networks and language processing.Some extra features could be implemented such as improving the accuracy of similarity, by taking more details into account. Also we could have more than just happy/sad sentiments, and maybe even analyse the main topic of the text.OxfordHackAlex Radu

485,OxfordHack,485,,485,"Rubber-band gun that shoots you if you look too happyTry not to laugh when faced with this!We're a team formed of CS students, a mathematician and an engineer. We have some very mixed skill sets, and so wanted to do something which everybody could work on. We had the idea of making some kind of catapult controlled by an Arduino, and that evolved into this.Players sit around the gun in a semi-circle. A camera moves back and forth taking photos of the players. If it detects that a player is laughing or looking too happy, the gun points towards them and shoots them!Works best when paired with a funny video playing in the centre of the players (thus the name ""Don't Laugh"").We have a Python script running which sends serial signals to an Arduino. The Arduino then moves the servos on which the camera and gun are mounted, as well as the servo used to pull the trigger. It uses OpenCV to take photos from a webcam mounted on a servo and the Microsoft Cognitive Services emotion API.When a photo is taken from the webcam, it's passed to the emotion API which returns a value for how happy the players are. If a particular player is looking too happy, the Python script tells the Arduino to move the gun and then shoot them!OpenCV is hard, especially with Python 3. It was also difficult to mount the servos on an assembly of some kind. We ended up using a beer bottle!It works! And the accuracy is actually pretty good. If there's one person in the group that's laughing, the gun will aim at that person and shoot.The gun also makes fake movements, just to freak the players out - you really don't know if it's going to hit you or not!All of us learned something different. Some learned Python, others OpenCV, and other Arduino programming.We're planning to develop more mini games and add more modes to the game.OxfordHackI worked on developing the idea, and the Python code to interface with the Arduino via serial.I worked with the hardware, making the gun, fitting the servos and programming the Arduino.I wrote the high-level logic and fit everyone else's pieces together.I wrote the interface to the Microsoft Cognitive Services API.Scott Street

It's magnificent, but looking at it, I felt kind of sad, and in between this sadness and admiration I started planing this experience.By reading the thoughts of the moon and the stars around, we will be able to see how lonely the moon feels, and how at the end is revealed that our perception is a key factor, and that we should need to learn to view things differently to understand better, and realize that we can be so hard on ourself and so wrong without reason.With this experience, maybe with an improved version will be better, I also expect people to understand other persons feelings, fomenting the empathy by understanding the moon, which is a character that everyone know and no one have bad feelings against, and with this experience open minds to what other people can feel, and trying to drive to a place where expressing this feelings or emotions is more normal and accepted than as in the current world we live nowadays.I coded it all in C++ from scratch.

Analyses photos in the album and evaluates emotions of people present on the photos. Plots a point on a 2D map and displays information about the event gathered from the Emotions API.A broad overview of our application is basically getting all the photos from Facebook and then passing the links on to the backend for further processing. The backend calls the Microsoft Cognitive API's for every image and does some minor data processing on the returned values and gives it back to the user. But it was even harder to implement this simple workflow. We started with just calling the cognitive api's through JavaScript but it took a lot of time to send all the images and do required calculations. So we thought of sending a message to an AWS SQS queue and wrote a Go server, which is attached to the queue and when it receives new messages, it calls the API for all the images concurrently thus bringing our execution time from about 10secs to 1-2secs. Apart from that we run node.js server on an EC2 instance and the frontend is written in Angular.js, HTML5 and CSS.The major challenges were basically related to concurrency in Go, eliminating data races, avoiding null pointers and reduce the number of goroutines. Also understanding the AWS SDK for Go lang was a big challenge and setting up the Simple Queue Service wasn't easy as well.Efficient use of multiple APIs and actually harnessing the power of Go and Amazon AWS.User registration, added functionality to save your map even when the session has expired.OxfordHackI worked on the frontend using Angular.js, HTML and CSS.

Get demographics and sentiment of people in front of your ads at public places.crowd reactions dashboardage distributionsentiment over timegender distributionsentiment over time with frames and extracted facesWe are bringing the capabilities of services like Google Analytics into the real world!
Allowing businesses to explore how people interact with billboards, posters and ads has tremendous value. 
And with our application, we can give the insights that people need to better target their audience in the physical world.We are using the Microsoft Cognitive Services to analyze video footages of people around things like billboards, posters or other kinds of advertisements. 
Using this footages, we can analyze facial features and determine how people react to whatever they are looking at. 
So we also can determine demographics such as age, gender and other characteristics to give insights into how the target audience looks like.Video footages are processed with the Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs.First, we process the video file to find the different faces through the video.
Then we generate frames for every point in the video where faces are recognized.These images are then slightly enhanced and go through further processing by the Faces API and Emotion API. 
This data is then aggregated using react.js and highchart to provide clear characteristics about the audience reactions and demographics. We could even tell you how many people wear glasses.Since we currently don't have a system with cameras attached to advertisements in places such as the London Underground, we don't have these footages to analyze. Therefore, we used timelaps videos of public places as a replacement. The charts shown in the images are based on this footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpHRp-WgQ0w.Even though we did not have much experience in the area of video processing, we accomplished fairly good results and were able to work with video footage without further problems.The tool-chain that we built to generate the final data has grown very quickly and has several intermediate steps. With this established tool-chain, it is easy to process further videos.We learned how to process video footage with the Microsoft Cognitive Services and how to use external libraries to generate images for specific frames in a video. We were astonished how fast we could achieve good results using the Microsoft Cognitive Services without training a dedicated model for this task.Currently we can track faces in the video of people in front of ads, but we can't say whether they look on their phone, at the ad or somewhere else. As a next step we want to build a custom face recognition model that also computes for each face the probability that this person ist actually looking at the ad. Furthermore, our current platform can process complete video files. This can be extended with an endpoint, which consumes video streams in real time.OxfordHackNico Ring

It is a tool that they can use on top of their existing clinical knowledge in order to confirm the interpretation of the ECG.We used a cardiac arrhythmia dataset from UC Irvine and taught our classifier to differentiate between normal ECGs and ECGs showing cardiac arrhythmias (eg heart attacks, heart blocks, sinus tachycardia, etc.).It was challenging to figure out what to teach the classifier, how to input the data, and how to structure it neatly. Connecting everyone's work was challenging too (front-end, machine learning algorithm, and back-end).We're proud that we could work together to get our project done within 24 hours! Teaching a machine to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmias and classifying it was technically challenging.We learnt a lot about Python, ECGs, scikit-learn, and machine learning!Instead of uploading csv files to input the data, it would be cool to just upload images so that pictures are just needed in order to interpret the ECGs.OxfordHackTzen Szen Toh

The goal of the game is to make the ball follow a highlighted path.Using the phone's accelerometer, we determined the components of gravity acting on the phone, and extended that to the motion of the ball.Our initial idea was to create an app that tracks the iPhone using the accelerometer and gyroscope. This app would guide the user to move in such a way as to simulate dancing. It proved to be very difficult to track the location of the phone in 3D space, so we ended up using the accelerometer reading to make a ball roll on the screen. The idea of the ball following the a line on the screen remained, just without the simulation of dancing. Of course, nothing is preventing the user from dancing while playing the game...In working on this project we created a level interface that makes level selection very smooth and easy on both the front and back end. However, we were not able to fully utilize it, nor create all the levels we desired.We improved our skills in swift and learned a lot of Linear Algebra during our initial attempt to create a dancing game.We hope to work out the formulas that the dancing portion of the game requires.OxfordHackDesigner and ArtistDrew Neely

As a multidisciplinary team, we wanted to incorporate all 4 areas to create an app which helps mental health patients. Depression and anxiety disorder cost $1 trillion per year (WHO), so this app could have medical and financial implications.Our research indicated that mood diary apps currently on the market require individuals to input their own emotional state. Research has shown that patients with mental health difficulties may not perceive their own emotional state accurately. As a result, we wanted to use software to analyse this instead.The app is a mood diary to monitor emotional states, allowing people to record their daily feelings and difficulties. This  feeds into Microsoft API to analyse text to check whether the sentiment was negative or positive, and offers advice for specific treatment goals. For example, it will direct patients displaying suicidal tendencies to the Samaritans hotline, provide patients with panic attacks management advice.If patients have 7 negatives in a row, they are prompted to call their psychiatrist or a close family member/friend via the Dialler. If patients input positive entries, only these will be listed on the front page.We planned on a white board for 2 hours to determine our main goals: a simple and accessible app. We built an Android app using Android Studio, and used Material Design combined with many libraries. This allowed us to use web Microsoft API (Text Analysis) for cognitive services.Using retrofit (a library for android development), we were able to send requests to the API, which gave us a sentiment score. This enabled us to know how positive/negative the user is feeling, as well as keywords to determine possible reasons for these extreme emotions. This prompted users with tailored advice.We used this to display all positive stories on the front page, whilst hiding negative messages from sight. However, if the user entered a large number of negative messages over a long period of time, this could indicate deteriorating mental health. The Dialler would then be launched to contact a friend/doctor.We used support libraries to make our application backward compatible, whilst still giving the material design to older phones. Libraries called RXJava and RXAndroid gave us cleaner code when developing.We used Adobe Illustrator to design a Material Design inspired app icon, and generated multiple different pixel densities. This allows for the icon to be viewed on a greater number of devies.Timing was very difficult, as we had created an ambitious project with many goals. Furthermore, some of us had never coded before. We intended to use Muse, but we could not access the technology for the 24 hours. The Pebble watches did not have pulse detection so we could not incorporate this.We tried to augment the new Microsoft API with IBM Watson Tone Analyser API, to give us a larger variety of emotions to select from. Potentially, this would have allowed us to assign percentages to measure the weighting of specific emotional states. However, due to the 24 hours time constraints, IBM were unable to accept our request for the beta trial in time.Three of us learnt how to code for the first time in only 24 hours at our very first hackathon. Our computer scientist learnt how to use the Microsoft API having never used it before. Also, he had never coded on Ubuntu Linux before during a hackathon.Those who had never coded before learnt basic programming skills, and our computer scientist learnt aspects of medicine and psychiatry.Incorporate Muse technology to analyse strong emotions via brain activity, or measuring pulse via a smartwatch. These would prompt patients to open their diary and log a new entry via a notification.Furthermore, we would have liked to incorporate location features with SkyScanner API to allow individuals to recommend hotels, restaurants, doctors etc. for people with similar mental health conditions. Also, location features with Esri could allow individuals to form local support groups, which has been shown to be beneficial.We would have liked to incorporate the Microsoft API more closely to pick up specific keywords, and offer even more specific tips to patients. This could be further improved with IBM Watson's API.A final touch would be to add a customisable personalised motivational wall on the front page. Patients could submit their own images, including motivational quotes and their favourite photos. This would aim to improve mental wellbeing over the long term.OxfordHackNot associated with this failure.Kushal Mansatta

However, there is no one service when it comes to events. There are several sites that offer a range of event suggestions but hosts either have to pay, be popular enough or sell tickets to them. The only platform that hosts events for free without any specific conditions is facebook. However, there is no functions to recommend events in your area. If you are looking for something specific, facebook is convenient, but not if you need inspiration on a friday night!Our app takes voice input from the user, like “show me events in london” and suggests events nearby sorted by categories like “concerts”, “food markets”, “seasonal”, along with time etc.With the aim of using voice recognition to find local events for users
The build consisted of a two-prong approach, involving an Android front-end and a Java based backend.
The Android front end component involved multiple API's, including Google's Speech Recognition, Facebook's Graph API for JSON retrieval of event data, as well as MonkeyLearn API for natural language processing elements.
The backend is written in Java using the Spring Boot framework for accessible REST calls. It is calling the Facebook Graph Event API to pull a list of events in the area, which is then filtering using calls to a trained NLP model on MonkeyLearn. The Endpoint is then exposed using ngrok.-Multiple rewrites and builds were executed due to numerous compatibility issues, but all were analyzd and resolved
-- Natural Language Processing: it is very hard to categorise the event names and descriptions for some events on facebook and put them into appropriate categories. Hard coding words is not an efficient approach therefore we used machine learning that uses a bag of words method. This method, however, is still not error-prone and relies on labelled data.-Excellent work distribution involving everyone's own strengths, with particular focus on redundancies incase an approach failed.
-- We are very proud of the team spirit, we quickly found each other, decided on the topic and divided the tasks.

This has numerous applications, such as in robotics, driverless cars, medical diagnosis and image editing. In all this cases, machines need to perceive and understand their environment in a manner similar to humans.There are now cloud services, such as the Microsoft Cognitive Services API. However, these do not offer a detailed, per-pixel understanding of images, which is what my system does.The algorithm identifies the object class of every single pixel in the image. For example, it labels certain pixels as ""person"", and others as ""car"" and so on. Furthermore, it identifies unique instances of objects as well: So if there are multiple people, then it should identify each person separately.The core of the system is implemented using deep neural networks, and described in my research papers (I am a PhD student). I had already trained a model to perform Semantic and Instance Segmentation as part of my research and conference paper submission.In the hackathon, I built a web interface to it, so that a user could upload images, or specify links to images on the internet, and see their result on unconstrained images.This runs on the cloud, on a Titan X GPU using Cuda.I don't really know much about building websites.It seems to work! The algorithm had previously only been evaluated on academic datasets. Now it is being tested on random images from the internet.I learnt a bit about Flask and building websites in Python.There will be some improvements to the core recognition algorithm.

Starting from London, you can pick your flight. The price of the flight you take is taken away from your wallet and the distance covered by your flight is added to your score. A flight corresponds to a game and the longer you remain on flight without hitting a cloud or falling off screen, the more money you gain.
This game is a combination  of strategy in terms of picking the best flights and gaming skills in terms of making a flight last as long as possible.We built it using node.js to get the flights data from the skyscanner api and C# with unity to create the front-end of the game.Getting the distance between two airports required getting a database of airports with their locations and using the latitude and longitude took us some time. We also had to learn C# and unity during the project and set up a webserver for highscores.Combining real world data with a simple game to make it fun and challenging.I learned C# and also how to use unity.Take off in one hour!OxfordHackI built the front-end of the game in C# and the user interface using unity.I worked on the backed storing highscore and using the Skyscanner API for flights.I worked on the high scoring system, specifically focused on converting the JSON format of storing data into usable data for Unity.Sixte de Maupeou d'Ableiges

When our team saw the power of Microsoft's emotion API, we saw an opportunity to fight that trend.Our app presents the user with several funny gifs. After a second or two of display, we take a picture of the user's face and send it to Microsoft's API to gauge their response. By gathering this data over time, we can alert users when they begin to react less and less to originally amusing things, which could indicate mild depression.The app is composed of an express server and a mongodb backend. The pictures are taken on any built-in webcam.Browsers understandably make it very hard for websites to access computer hardware. It took many iterations, but we eventually found an approach that works for all platforms we've tested.As a team of mostly newbies, we're extremely proud of how we pulled together and built something significant out of technologies we'd never worked with before.From Git to Express, our whole team worked with new and interesting technologies. We learned a lot about programming and collaborative coding.The gifs need to be classified and some universal metrics need to be calculated. Measuring an individual's response only against their own history is prone to random fluctuation in short term moods and the quality of the gifs.

This is a problem we are now facing after graduation and finding jobs in new places. If you know two locations it is easy enough to query directly, but with hundreds of places within a reasonable distance, it is very difficult to work out the best options. Commute allows you to input your workplace, an amount of time you are willing to commute for and a method of transport.Given your work destination, choose how you would like to commute and the maximum amount of time you are willing to travel. Commute will show a map of potential places to live, with options to visualise layers of geographic data from ArcGIS OpenData in .geojson format.We aggregated data from a number of sources on UK locations in order to build a database of locations, names, population sizes and distances. This allowed us to filter the number of queries beign passed to the Google Maps Distance Matrix to improve loading times (and save requests to our API key!) After getting the travel time with Google, we then plotted the map on the front end with the Esri API and used their layers and OpenData to add contextual information.Finding reliable data on place names in usable formats was difficult. We used a .csv file from GeoNames and an excel spreadsheet from a Government FOI request. Parsing this data and storing it in the database in an efficient way was one of the biggest challenges.Producing a list of reasonable results in a reasonable time, for a genuine problem we have recently experienced. It was fun to see locations along the main train lines highlighted - also highlights the limitations of public transport in rural areas!Neither of us had much prior experience in javascript, so using the Esri API was a challenge but a rewarding one.We want to add a number of features - house price data particularly would make the tool much more useful to a wider audience. We would also like to find more data sources and allow the user to filter the results based on these.

Although there exist projects that use SkyScanner API to optimize travel path by the price or the distance, we wanted to optimize it by another variable that might be more meaningful to a person. That's why we came up with interest-based traveling salesman problem enabling end-users to find their optimal journey based on their interests, for example, museums, pubs or theaters.The webpage takes the user's list of interest and their location as a starting destination, along the dates and the preferred radius of travel. The output is a journey planned on the map based on their interests at the same time minimizing the prize with the SkyScanner.The website takes the user interests as an input along with a current location as a starting point for TSP problem. It uses Google Maps API to find the closest major cities within the specified radius and computes interest-related best cities to visit based on the average rating of the places on Google Maps. The cities are then passed onto SkyScanner API to search for the cheapest flights and routes. All combinations of these routes are passed onto the Traveling Salesmen Problem which computes the best path. The path and coordinates are then passed back to Esri API and displayed as a route on the map.We had all the components working separately but with the limit of time we found it difficult to join them together smoothly. Because of this, a lot of details we wanted to include had to be omitted (for example displaying details of the route which is a very easy and logical next step), so that we could present the full product. Also, we used a lot of separate components, which was a challenge with respect to time.We all value the technologies that we learned, and above all the sense of achievement that came from fully working product that we achieved through teamworkthe use of various APIs, Django, how to interface between front-end and back-endWe want to include more information about the journeys and most of all, add more variables to optimize for example weather information.OxfordHackJola Mirecka

It draws data from the Skyscanner API to do so.The original idea was to use the Esri API; however, there were technical issues with parsing the data into a geolocation database object that can be rendered by the layer, so we migrated to the WebGL API, feeding it with the JSON data drawn from the Skyscanner API.The Esri API did not offer some of the functionalities that we needed, i.e. we could not process the data to be passed into the Layer, without having access to their server (which is a paid service). There were issues with making calls to the Skyscanner API, which was only resolved in the night. We had to manually write the gaussian blur for the heat map, before mapping it to the globe. After mapping it to the globe, we had to re-plot the points on the globe, without the data stacking.Despite the setbacks, we finally managed to complete the project, even though we had to start from scratch during the night.How difficult it is to hack into APIs without proper documentation and few features, as well as the difficulty in deploying to AWS.Mapping the data to history would allow people to plan their holidays in advance, so that they can make the best choices.

Requires some enthusiatic acting and imagination.This uses an Arduino Uno, an accelerometer, 3 breadboards, 7 neopixels and a portable phone charger. I used code from an existing project featuring a wand that controls a tv, and edited it to fit the LEDs and the effects I wanted. Accelerometers are notoriously inconsistent so it took some time to get the numbers right- they were usually very different than the original code.Initially had some issues getting the LEDs going before realising I used the wrong resistor (took far too long to realise). Getting the values right took time. The main issue I am still dealing with is the consistency of the accelerometer- it sometimes gives off random numbers as feedback, which in turn calls functions at the wrong time. Because of this I had to remove a (very pretty!) rainbow function, as it was getting called randomly.Proud I got it all done in a reasonable time before the deadline! It's not my most ambitious project but it was a bit of fun.I've never used an accelerometer before so I learned how the values are read and used. I also learned a bit more about the neopixel library- mainly that it will be very difficult for me to write my own patterns for my LEDs.I would have loved to have taken this off the breadboard and onto an actual wand, but due to time and soldering constraints that was not to be. It would definitely be fun to do that in the future.OxfordHackLeah Thomas

MAGICFirst ever hack, learning using code academy as I went along. Wanted to produce a website that allowed anybody to do a magic trick with very little practice. Work as a professional magician, and want to change my answer after I perform from, 'sorry, I can't tell you how I did that' to 'here's something that you can learn'.It's an online magic trick. Read the instructions page first if you are using it. A person thinks of a card, or three people (one picks the colour, one picks the suit, one picks the value), they can change their mind as much as they want and you do not influence their decision. Whatever they say, when you click on the link a picture of their chosen card comes up.I used the code academy tutorial to learn how to initially write the basic code structure in html and css. Then I learnt how to put in the appropriate images and links onto the page, and on each letter. Didn't know what software to put the code that I had written into, so I just coded into the text file on my wordpress website on a new page. Started by coming up with a set of words that could be split into 4 instructions, to represent the four suits, with 13 characters in each instruction (minus spaces) to represent the 13 potential card values in each suit. Then coded each individual letter to correspond to each playing card (this took the bulk of the time as I had to attach an image link to every letter). I then reformatted all the information so that it was in one line as a sentence and added a title. Created a new instructions page and added a link to that. Then coded in the pictures and links, as well as centre lining the text and making it look nice. Finally I added a link from the instructions to my website (not coded during the hackathon), because... why not right?The biggest challenge I faced was convincing myself to start learning to code, then it was ensuring that all of the code was formatted and the website looked nice. Coming up with the word combination was difficult, as was ensuring that the link looked as much like one single hyperlink as possible.Finally got around to learning to code, and am now looking forward to working on many more exciting projects. Also proud to have come up with the idea and then gone on to execute it. Proud that it was all written in actual code rather than just editing the words on wordpress as I usually do with my website.How to use html/css. How to create headings, change font sizes, import images, add hyperlinks, add image hyperlinks, reformat code to become one sentence, work continuously for a few hours without procrastinating.Definitely going to design some more magic tricks that people can do for their friends using the platform. Hope to make them even better and far more difficult to figure out. Maybe also mix coding with some real life magic tricks. Also hope to do a psychology page where people can take part in experiments (eg. implicit association tests) to see if they have implicit biases and how they compare to the rest of the population.OxfordHackRomil Depala

Thus was born the idea of a new input for phones - a way of typing that would get rid of the typing aspect entirely by streamlining the process.FineType allows the user to input text characters purely through the use of hand motions and without the use of an on-screen keyboard.We used Java and the Android Studio IDE to build FineType.We found that the process of switching between groups of characters and between the characters inside each group a tedious process that kept bugging out for us. Eventually, the fix was found as a time delay for switching.We're proud of the way we graphically represented to the user when they switched between the blocks of characters and which block they were on.We learned how to access accelerometer readings from an Android phone, along with negating gravity in accelerometer equations. We also learned how to create a GUI interface in Android Studio, an IDE with which we had no experience at all for creating apps - in fact, we created our first ever mobile app here at OxfordHack.FineType's next steps would be to smooth the user experience by reducing the amount of errors that come from unexpected diagonal movement, smoothing the amount of noise experienced by the app from random movement, and adding features like capitalization, spacing, and repeating characters in a row.OxfordHackI worked full-stackI worked full stack for FineTypeTyler  Xu

If someone were to, perhaps, spend a long time working without being productive, this app could provide insights into why this was the case: it would highlight cases when a user would have trouble focusing.We used Python and Ruby, as well as the Muse research tools. For the data analysis, we used Jupyter and scikit-learn. For the perfect UX and design, we leveraged Comic Sans MS™ and a patented marquee implementation.It's very difficult to analyze and classify traces of EEG activity in such a limited timeframe. Moreover, collecting clean data with no distractions is nearly impossible in hackathon conditions.We collected quite a lot of data of people performing various activities while wearing the Muse headband. The accelerometer-based computer control interface also works quite well!EEG-powered human-computer interaction is possible, i.e., the signal does exist in the data. With appropriate training data collection and analysis, one could definitely build a real-time computer control system using EEG.We would like to improve our data collection conditions, and build a more robust pipeline for the data cleaning.OxfordHackFirst time working this closely with custom hardware, and definitely the first time analyzing EEG data.

In this game the character has to follow game hints that lead to the player answering the phone to a friend who sends information about the location of a portal to a magical world. The way 3d graphics engines work greatly interests me so for fun, instead of using a program like unity that does the 3d for you, for this project I aimed to create a 3d game using just JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, paint images and screenshots I would take of 3d objects.
 I created 3D objects using SkectchUp then screenshotted these scenery models from lots of different angles and used JavaScript and jQuery to control when these images were displayed to create a 3d game experience for the user. I also used Photoshop to make the images backgrounds transparent where appropriate. The game includes some third person scenes in which the players width and height is multiplied by scalar values based on its y-coordinate to create perspective and show when the player is close or far away. This scene also includes some quick first person moments which occur when an object of great importance to the games story appears and the user is able to view this item in first person. This was done to make sure the user sees this object up close and notices it. As the player opens the portal the world distorts a bit to empathise the magical powers of the portal. Magic dust also appears above the flashing portal. Once the portal is opened the magical world is all in first person. The player is transported to a magical castle which they can freely walk up and down one corridor of. The corridor appears clear at first but as soon as the player starts to walk an enchanted floating hat appears. 
When making the game I came across many challenges. One of these was that the number of screenshots needed to make a smooth running 3D game was too large. I had to compromise and limit the number of images used to a reasonable number. I also struggled with problems caused by code written for different stages of the game affecting thing in a part of the game they were not intended for. The solution to this was to give each stage of the game a boolean variable that tracks if it should have started running yet or not. This helped me keep track of which stage of the game the user was in and what code should and shouldn’t run for this stage of the game. 
The main thing I leant was how to make the 3d for the first person scene in the game (in the castle scene). In the future, to expand on the game I could make the game longer so that you can explore more of the castle.OxfordHackHannah Sheard

This is a problem we are now facing after graduation and finding jobs in new places. If you know two locations it is easy enough to query directly, but with hundreds of places within a reasonable distance, it is very difficult to work out the best options. Commute allows you to input your workplace, an amount of time you are willing to commute for and a method of transport.Given your work destination, choose how you would like to commute and the maximum amount of time you are willing to travel. Commute will show a map of potential places to live, with options to visualise layers of geographic data from ArcGIS OpenData in .geojson format.We aggregated data from a number of sources on UK locations in order to build a database of locations, names, population sizes and distances. This allowed us to filter the number of queries beign passed to the Google Maps Distance Matrix to improve loading times (and save requests to our API key!) After getting the travel time with Google, we then plotted the map on the front end with the Esri API and used their layers and OpenData to add contextual information.Finding reliable data on place names in usable formats was difficult. We used a .csv file from GeoNames and an excel spreadsheet from a Government FOI request. Parsing this data and storing it in the database in an efficient way was one of the biggest challenges.Producing a list of reasonable results in a reasonable time, for a genuine problem we have recently experienced. It was fun to see locations along the main train lines highlighted - also highlights the limitations of public transport in rural areas!Neither of us had much prior experience in javascript, so using the Esri API was a challenge but a rewarding one.We want to add a number of features - house price data particularly would make the tool much more useful to a wider audience. We would also like to find more data sources and allow the user to filter the results based on these.

Although there exist projects that use SkyScanner API to optimize travel path by the price or the distance, we wanted to optimize it by another variable that might be more meaningful to a person. That's why we came up with interest-based traveling salesman problem enabling end-users to find their optimal journey based on their interests, for example, museums, pubs or theaters.The webpage takes the user's list of interest and their location as a starting destination, along the dates and the preferred radius of travel. The output is a journey planned on the map based on their interests at the same time minimizing the prize with the SkyScanner.The website takes the user interests as an input along with a current location as a starting point for TSP problem. It uses Google Maps API to find the closest major cities within the specified radius and computes interest-related best cities to visit based on the average rating of the places on Google Maps. The cities are then passed onto SkyScanner API to search for the cheapest flights and routes. All combinations of these routes are passed onto the Traveling Salesmen Problem which computes the best path. The path and coordinates are then passed back to Esri API and displayed as a route on the map.We had all the components working separately but with the limit of time we found it difficult to join them together smoothly. Because of this, a lot of details we wanted to include had to be omitted (for example displaying details of the route which is a very easy and logical next step), so that we could present the full product. Also, we used a lot of separate components, which was a challenge with respect to time.We all value the technologies that we learned, and above all the sense of achievement that came from fully working product that we achieved through teamworkthe use of various APIs, Django, how to interface between front-end and back-endWe want to include more information about the journeys and most of all, add more variables to optimize for example weather information.OxfordHackJola Mirecka

Well...we are all about sightseeing. We take our time.Sleepless hours, spilled blood and dead bugs are no far from the truth. Coming from a background involving hardcore C#-ing, C++ and Django, we thought about using none of those! 24 hours, of which 23 trying to understand what we were actually typing and one to write this epic story... Our salvation came in the form of API-s and open source. We will never forget our stranger friends. Not only we made the web, but it actually runs.Crazy words, blue screen due to 100+ tabs and sleep deprivation. Not to speak about each and single new line of code. At one point, Facebook refused our conversations. We thought about using git. But it was not hardcore enough. While we were trying to figure out javascript...we got into jquery.. We tried to run away from it, but we weren't fast enough. During morning hours, we had a moment of weakness in which we just collapsed. We woke up 15 minutes later, with no memory of our code. Of course, this did not stop us! We had to keep fighting! We had to prevail! Cheap version of red bull after cheap version of redbull and we were closer and closer to deploying our project. One thing we forgot. We forgot to learn Chinese (Microsoft Cognitive Services).. little did we know..We can type jquery in 3 different ways. We added 3 more languages, including a bit of Chinese. We mumbled-jumbled our way thought this hack. We proved ourselves brave and limitless. We attended countless challenges, being involved in machine learning and competitive programming as well as in actually finishing our hack. We even won some points for our houses.Except for the languages, to trust each other. I mean, I found it hard at first to let another pair of hands mess with my code.Fixing the totally not existing bugs. Solving the NP-complete part of it. Some glory along the way. Voice integration for ease of access and semi-AI just to take a part of the challenge of deciding what to visit next.

This would be useful to those who are avoiding the crowd, and who are looking for the cheaper destinations.It generates a heatmap on the WebGL API, which identifies the destinations with lots of flights, using a self-written Gaussian function. It draws data from the Skyscanner API to do so.The original idea was to use the Esri API; however, there were technical issues with parsing the data into a geolocation database object that can be rendered by the layer, so we migrated to the WebGL API, feeding it with the JSON data drawn from the Skyscanner API.The Esri API did not offer some of the functionalities that we needed, i.e. we could not process the data to be passed into the Layer, without having access to their server (which is a paid service). There were issues with making calls to the Skyscanner API, which was only resolved in the night. We had to manually write the gaussian blur for the heat map, before mapping it to the globe. After mapping it to the globe, we had to re-plot the points on the globe, without the data stacking.Despite the setbacks, we finally managed to complete the project, even though we had to start from scratch during the night.How difficult it is to hack into APIs without proper documentation and few features, as well as the difficulty in deploying to AWS.Mapping the data to history would allow people to plan their holidays in advance, so that they can make the best choices. We would also like to be able to write an algorithm that would identify the next best (nearest and cheapest) destination that people can look for as an alternative.OxfordHackSara Chen

541,OxfordHack,541,,541,"A wand that reacts to movementSince this is a Harry Potter themed hackathon, I felt the need to create something matching the theme that allows us muggles to get a taste of what it's like to be a wizard.When the user moves the wand, the 7 LEDs change colour and pattern depending on it's orientation. Requires some enthusiatic acting and imagination.This uses an Arduino Uno, an accelerometer, 3 breadboards, 7 neopixels and a portable phone charger. I used code from an existing project featuring a wand that controls a tv, and edited it to fit the LEDs and the effects I wanted. Accelerometers are notoriously inconsistent so it took some time to get the numbers right- they were usually very different than the original code.Initially had some issues getting the LEDs going before realising I used the wrong resistor (took far too long to realise). Getting the values right took time. The main issue I am still dealing with is the consistency of the accelerometer- it sometimes gives off random numbers as feedback, which in turn calls functions at the wrong time. Because of this I had to remove a (very pretty!) rainbow function, as it was getting called randomly.Proud I got it all done in a reasonable time before the deadline! It's not my most ambitious project but it was a bit of fun.I've never used an accelerometer before so I learned how the values are read and used. I also learned a bit more about the neopixel library- mainly that it will be very difficult for me to write my own patterns for my LEDs.I would have loved to have taken this off the breadboard and onto an actual wand, but due to time and soldering constraints that was not to be. It would definitely be fun to do that in the future.OxfordHackLeah Thomas

MAGICFirst ever hack, learning using code academy as I went along. Wanted to produce a website that allowed anybody to do a magic trick with very little practice. Work as a professional magician, and want to change my answer after I perform from, 'sorry, I can't tell you how I did that' to 'here's something that you can learn'.It's an online magic trick. Read the instructions page first if you are using it. A person thinks of a card, or three people (one picks the colour, one picks the suit, one picks the value), they can change their mind as much as they want and you do not influence their decision. Whatever they say, when you click on the link a picture of their chosen card comes up.I used the code academy tutorial to learn how to initially write the basic code structure in html and css. Then I learnt how to put in the appropriate images and links onto the page, and on each letter. Didn't know what software to put the code that I had written into, so I just coded into the text file on my wordpress website on a new page. Started by coming up with a set of words that could be split into 4 instructions, to represent the four suits, with 13 characters in each instruction (minus spaces) to represent the 13 potential card values in each suit. Then coded each individual letter to correspond to each playing card (this took the bulk of the time as I had to attach an image link to every letter). I then reformatted all the information so that it was in one line as a sentence and added a title. Created a new instructions page and added a link to that. Then coded in the pictures and links, as well as centre lining the text and making it look nice. Finally I added a link from the instructions to my website (not coded during the hackathon), because... why not right?The biggest challenge I faced was convincing myself to start learning to code, then it was ensuring that all of the code was formatted and the website looked nice. Coming up with the word combination was difficult, as was ensuring that the link looked as much like one single hyperlink as possible.Finally got around to learning to code, and am now looking forward to working on many more exciting projects. Also proud to have come up with the idea and then gone on to execute it. Proud that it was all written in actual code rather than just editing the words on wordpress as I usually do with my website.How to use html/css. How to create headings, change font sizes, import images, add hyperlinks, add image hyperlinks, reformat code to become one sentence, work continuously for a few hours without procrastinating.Definitely going to design some more magic tricks that people can do for their friends using the platform. Hope to make them even better and far more difficult to figure out. Maybe also mix coding with some real life magic tricks. Also hope to do a psychology page where people can take part in experiments (eg. implicit association tests) to see if they have implicit biases and how they compare to the rest of the population.OxfordHackRomil Depala

Eventually, the fix was found as a time delay for switching.We're proud of the way we graphically represented to the user when they switched between the blocks of characters and which block they were on.We learned how to access accelerometer readings from an Android phone, along with negating gravity in accelerometer equations. We also learned how to create a GUI interface in Android Studio, an IDE with which we had no experience at all for creating apps - in fact, we created our first ever mobile app here at OxfordHack.FineType's next steps would be to smooth the user experience by reducing the amount of errors that come from unexpected diagonal movement, smoothing the amount of noise experienced by the app from random movement, and adding features like capitalization, spacing, and repeating characters in a row.OxfordHackI worked full-stackI worked full stack for FineTypeTyler  Xu

If someone were to, perhaps, spend a long time working without being productive, this app could provide insights into why this was the case: it would highlight cases when a user would have trouble focusing.We used Python and Ruby, as well as the Muse research tools. For the data analysis, we used Jupyter and scikit-learn. For the perfect UX and design, we leveraged Comic Sans MS™ and a patented marquee implementation.It's very difficult to analyze and classify traces of EEG activity in such a limited timeframe. Moreover, collecting clean data with no distractions is nearly impossible in hackathon conditions.We collected quite a lot of data of people performing various activities while wearing the Muse headband.

In this game the character has to follow game hints that lead to the player answering the phone to a friend who sends information about the location of a portal to a magical world. The way 3d graphics engines work greatly interests me so for fun, instead of using a program like unity that does the 3d for you, for this project I aimed to create a 3d game using just JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, paint images and screenshots I would take of 3d objects.
 I created 3D objects using SkectchUp then screenshotted these scenery models from lots of different angles and used JavaScript and jQuery to control when these images were displayed to create a 3d game experience for the user. I also used Photoshop to make the images backgrounds transparent where appropriate. The game includes some third person scenes in which the players width and height is multiplied by scalar values based on its y-coordinate to create perspective and show when the player is close or far away. This scene also includes some quick first person moments which occur when an object of great importance to the games story appears and the user is able to view this item in first person. This was done to make sure the user sees this object up close and notices it. As the player opens the portal the world distorts a bit to empathise the magical powers of the portal. Magic dust also appears above the flashing portal. Once the portal is opened the magical world is all in first person. The player is transported to a magical castle which they can freely walk up and down one corridor of. The corridor appears clear at first but as soon as the player starts to walk an enchanted floating hat appears. 
When making the game I came across many challenges. One of these was that the number of screenshots needed to make a smooth running 3D game was too large. I had to compromise and limit the number of images used to a reasonable number. I also struggled with problems caused by code written for different stages of the game affecting thing in a part of the game they were not intended for. The solution to this was to give each stage of the game a boolean variable that tracks if it should have started running yet or not. This helped me keep track of which stage of the game the user was in and what code should and shouldn’t run for this stage of the game. 
The main thing I leant was how to make the 3d for the first person scene in the game (in the castle scene). In the future, to expand on the game I could make the game longer so that you can explore more of the castle.OxfordHackHannah Sheard

The challenge announced by Noma was to create a solution to the following problem:How do we help a potential occupier understand size and available space options in a building without physically 
taking them there?We began with the end user in mind. Who would actually be using this product?The operator is going to be the agencies trying to let the spaces in the buildings. The user would be anyone interested in occupying the building. We do not make assumptions about the technical abilities of either of these users. Hence we needed to devise something which was intuitive to use, but not too difficult to set up. Virtual reality is one option, as it allows the potential occupier to 'walk' around the office, and get a real feel for the size.We couldn't use an Oculus Rift. Here's why:We decided to go instead with the Google Cardboard:There are two parts to the system, the website, and the mobile application.The Website is for use by the operator - the building space retailer. It provides a very simple interface which allows the user to draw out the scene, and then see a very basic visualisation of how the scene might look in three dimensions. It provides options for visualising the scene, clearing any mistakes, and sending the data over to the mobile application.The mobile application was built for Android, and allowed the display to be configured for Virtual Reality. With simplicity in mind, the user only needs to launch the app, request the data from the website with a simple click, then put the phone in the headset to have a look around.The website was developed with the standard suite of web languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For the CSS, we used Bootstrap to ensure that there was a consistent style guide, and to make the webpage pseudo-responsive. For the 3D modelling and display, we used three.js to provide a JavaScript wrapper for OpenGL. We also used jQuery to send AJAX requests to build the API.We took the following approach to building the website:The application was build with Unity, which provides tools to create Virtual Reality scenes. The application connected to the API and downloaded a matrix representing the geometry of the space. It then goes through the matrix and procedurally generates the space. The user is then able to move around the scene by using the phone's gyrometer, and by performing different actions.Who knows? :)GreatUniHack Fall 2016I was responsible for leading the team and building the website part of the application.Struan McDonough

553,GreatUniHack Fall 2016,553,,553,"Extending human sensory perception to wi-fi signals with musicWimphonyWe have all had thoughts of what it would be like to travel within the internet. Wimphony, a combination of the words wifi and symphony, is an application that can bring us one step closer to that dream.In reality we just wanted to build something cool and representing wi-fi signals sounded like it fit the bill.Wimphony takes an Android phone and uses the built in wi-fi antenna to scan for networks around and their signal strength. It then generates a piece of music for each wi-fi network and places them in a virtual world at a location relative to their real world position. You can then explore this virtual world using a Google cardboard, with spacial perception of the sounds and by extension the wi-fi networks.We divided the building of the app into an Android component, music generation, back-end plumbing and VR. The music generation and back-end plumbing were done in Python with Flask sitting on top of it. The VR component was written using Unity and C#.We chose this project explicitly because we would all be working in areas that we were not really comfortable in. This meant that we ran into our fair share of problems along the way, but also that we learnt a bunch whilst doing so.Actually getting music generated from a wi-fi network was a big moment for us, as was placing this sound into the virtual world as a point source. More importantly however, every member of the team pushed themselves to learn many new things.Getting the app fully integrated so that there was end-to-end data flow would be the next step. After that, the codebase would need to be secured if it was to sit on the public internet for any time whatsoever. We could also improve and diversify the music generation algorithm, for example including different genres of music or using different instrument synthesisers/polyphonic tunes.GreatUniHack Fall 2016I worked on the Android app and acted as resident Python/C# consultant.I was responsible for designing the sound generator and synthesizer in python. The final result of my work is able to take input of names of available wi-fi networks and use them as seeds for a random number generator. Than it generates a short sequence of musical notes for each wi-fi network visible. I also worked on the Android side, reading data off the wi-fi antenna and establishing a connection to a server.Worked on the visual delivery on the app, creating complex scenes in Unity3D with Google VR support; taking in data about audio positioned points from the backend server and creating binaural and spatialised scenes for content consumption.Created the database, http input/output and website, mainly using python(flask, sqlalchemy) and a little html/css.Cameron MacLeod

Inspiration came from Sam out of personal need.So far the app imports your Google Calendar timetable. We intended it to also ask for your preferences when it comes to study time (hours per week, subjects per day, etc.). The email addresses of your lecturers for each subject would also be saved and your location mapped whenever a scheduled lecture begins. The app will send an email to your lecturer on your behalf if you're not where you're supposed to be at that time with a random message, saying how silly you are, which is hopefully an incentive to come.After getting Android Studio to work, we tried to figure out the Google Calendar API and Android programming in general. This was difficult unfortunately, given our rusty knowledge of Java. We used a virtual machine to test the app.None of us had ever programmed for Android before, and it took a while to download the API. The app right now is still more of a proof of concept.We learned that developing for Android isn't as simple as you think. We're more eager than ever to learn new technologies and technical skills in our own time. Being our first Hackathon, we burned out pretty quickly and found it hard to work past the early morning hours. Even though things didn't quite go to plan, our team spirit has never been stronger.Once we get a better grasp of Android app development, we expand the app to its full potential.GreatUniHack Fall 2016Sam Rimington

I thought I'd really like one but there was no way I could afford a professional one, so what other option did I have but to make my own?! After recently seeing a talk about the Web Audio API at a conference, I really wanted to try it out, so I thought I would!Using an iRig (or some other device/cable) you plug your guitar into your phone and open up the 'play' page of amp in a browser. Then open the 'listen' page on another device and you'll be able to hear the amplified guitar playing - no wires between the two!It uses the Web Audio API to get the input from the guitar, which effectively acts like a microphone when plugged into the phone. It then uses Socket.io-p2p to stream the audio via WebRTC to the 'listen' page. The Node.js server is there only to serve the static pages and to facilitate the handshaking of the p2p WebRTC connection between the 'play' and 'listen' pages.The Web Audio API is still under active development (read: everybody is still arguing about how it should work), and so is WebRTC. Having previously used Socket.io many times, I thought it would be a good idea to use their p2p module to stream the audio. In the end it worked out okay, but the documentation was a bit rubbish.Another major issue is the latency. When running the 'play' and 'listen' clients on the same machine, the latency is manageable, but over the network it's too much to be able to play guitar. This does somewhat invalidate this entire hack, but please ignore that fact.I managed to get Socket.io-p2p working, something that as far as I can work out, not that many people have done. It ended up being a great wrapper for WebRTC, but the documentation really needs work. I've started on making an example of how to do media streaming over it, which I plan to submit a pull request for as this is something totally undocumented as of right now.WebRTC is pretty cool, and definitely something to look out for in the future. Same goes for the Web Audio API. Good documentation is also crazy important (but definitely already knew this).I'd really like to look into adding some traditional-style guitar effects (distortion, etc). Reducing the latency is probably top of the list for now though. Not entirely sure how I can do that!GreatUniHack Fall 2016I spoke with the computer, and the computer listened to meScott Street

We also built a chrome extension to show the algorithms performance and intelligence.We built an API in python flask which connected to a Postgresql database. We decided to use an object relational mapper to integrate with our database. We used python's natural language toolkit in conjunction with Google's bad words to train our model.The biggest challenge was our skill gap, we were passionate about learning something new and wanted to come into the project with an open mind. All of the team learned something new.Using NLP was a huge challenge for our project, but we are really proud of our algorithm and chrome app. We learned a lot of new skills that we wouldn't have through of learning outside the algorithm.We didn't know anything about natural language processing before we started this project. We found a research paper that detailed methods with which to recognise online harassment.One of our teammates had never used python before so he was able to learn in trial by fire.We can index more of the web and gather more data in order to provide services that may be useful to advertising companies who wish to avoid being affiliated with negative websites. We could also see our API and algorithm being used on online forums and comment sections to minimize potential harassment and hate speech.GreatUniHack Fall 2016I worked on the front-end, came up with the idea, did the mockups and helped work on the overall concept and goals we wanted the browser extension to achieve.Not only does HarassBlock help everyday users be aware of sites that are potentially offensive it also allows users to anonymously vote so that sites can be ranked and categorised.This data is all stored in a cloud database that can then be accessed by third parties such as advertisers - allowing them insight into potential problems a campaign could face if it continues to so business with an offensive website.We can also use the data that users submit via voting to determine what are considered the most offensive terms and phrasing in today's society. Our database will over time become an extremely sophisticated tool for many potential customers while at the same time protecting those that are most vulnerable from offensive material.Hussein Mohammed

We saw the potential with current trends towards gamification and social connectivity and thought we could add a business related spin to it.Our software allows users to create projects and certified investors can register interest, and send messages to the entrepreneurs. They can do this through a web app, android and ios apps.We designed and built the API using a combination of technologies, making extensive use of NoSQL and JSON Web Tokens for cutting edge security.Because our data is inherently relational, using a non-relational database was always going to be a challenge (not least because most of our background is in msSQL and MySQL),  we thought we'd give a different technology a chance and are very happy with the results.Setting up the various build configurations for Android and iOS was a major challenge, as because we were using the very latest (unstable beta technology) we had to solve these problems without reliable documentation and questionable forum posts. However, we did manage to do it and managed to create our Minimum Viable Product.Getting the messaging system working, which is a piece of core functionality and makes the app a viable piece of digital equipment for investors and creators alike.Producing apps for multiple platforms through up lots of pretty specific edge cases and challenges, and to finally get it working on our devices was great to see.Adding more functionality: such as location based investment opportunities, image uploads and 'sliding' cards when dragged.

And after spending a decent amount of money there is nothing what you can do with your Blu-ray disc, right? We have a solution to this problem, a recurrent neural network that is able to generate new levels for your game!Based on experience, a set of Mario Bros maps, the network generates new levels. The only thing we require from you is a length of a map as well as the crazy factor. Cause why keep stuff boring?We built this using Keras, a python library for deep learning networks. We first took maps available online, turned them into ASCII representation using OpenCV and then feed the text as the training set for the network. After generating a new ASCII map we turned them again to Javascript format, which is understandable by the version of Mario we are using.At the beginning we were trying to build a network able playing Mario itself, unfortunately we had to leave this one, since it very hard to setup the feedback step. We focused on the generating new maps only.It is working!A better understanding of recurrent neural networks. <3GreatUniHack Fall 2016Grzegorz Jacenków

Our team thought that the task of working with virtual reality, modelling and innovation  was the most suitable so we built upon it.The hack itself is basically set to innovate the way people buy real estate: instead of going to every single location by foot or car, the customer would have the ability to meet with an agent or just view the estate from home with any VR headset. But our project does not just stop there - the main goal is to not only be able to view the rooms, but to actually customize them yourself! You could add any furniture you desire just to have a better feel on how a specific property tailors to your needs! In addition to that, the engine would work in such a way that you only need to implement the type of housing you need (office, flat, etc.), the amount of occupants and the system will automatically generate a room with certain types of furniture in it in a specific formation. The last thing to be implemented would be a machine learning algorithm that actually learns from customers needs and makes better assumptions as to what type of house to offer!The project was build by using a simple piece of hardware and a few pieces of software, that being the the famous Samsung VR gear, 3D modeling software BLENDER and last but certainly not least, the Unreal Engine for the actual mapping of items and surroundings. We decided to use the Unreal engine as it has a really friendly user interface called ""blueprint"" that actually helps minimize the amount of low level code and move building blocks of the program into a more high level environment.During our development path we have encountered quite a few hurdles: the largest of them being the massive struggle with the Oculus rift. The main issue with the rift was that we spent an actual 9 hours trying to get it to work on our laptops. We went to the extent of trying a campus computer to no avail. This automatically led to a loss of precious time, but we managed to get back from it and come back with a bang! The setback did not terminate our drive and we came out with a finished alpha version of the app that we are very proud to present!We manage to deal with the setback from the OCULUS, dealt with numerous errors from Unreal engine, and finally came out with a working product!We have learned a great lesson in teamwork as well as actual software and hardware skills that helped us implement our project!Who knows, the app might one day reach an actual beta version!GreatUniHack Fall 2016Created a back end C++ algorithm to determine the required room size, from the available, and generate the initial layout depending on the number of employees and the work space style. The initial map is then set up for the user to explore and tweak. I had never coded in C++ before, only C; so the differences between the two languages became apparent to me.I created the 3d models for the app and set up Unreal Engine.Applied my knowledge in C++ to aid my teammates in developing the actual project (algorithm). Helped troubleshoot various issues during the project and prepared the Powerpoint presentation.I helped code the back-end algorithm written in C++ and creation of Blueprints in Unreal Engine. This was my first time using Unreal Engine and C++ so I learned a lot about the engine (plus another programming language to stick on the ol' CV).Mantas Navickas

577,GreatUniHack Fall 2016,577,,577,"A speech-to-text adventure with Raspberry PiHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and many other cool text adventures. We were
also very excited to work with Alexa following our previous failed attempts with
other hardware such as the Sigfox board and Estimote - after attempting to make
a device-based hide-and-seek game to no avail, we continued to explore ideas
involving different types of games, including a reaction-based buzzer game,
but the idea of a text-based game in Alexa quickly won it for us.Alexa offers one text-based adventure game dictated between you and your Amazon Echo device, based on our experiences at GreatUniHack 2016, albeit with a little more gruesome death from lack of self-care...if you don't play it right.Initially we experimented with some Bluetooth, GPS and NFC devices with ideas such as a hide-and-seek game and access control for the workplace with some helpful widgets. However, hardware failed us, and we were not able to carry out these ideas, so after a fairly speedy brainstorm we chose to rely on the Amazon Echo for text-based games. The statistics for this are viewable via a web frontend powered by jQuery and PHP, and all information is also retrievable via the Echo, which itself recognises users entered into a database on the website.The first six and a half hours were pretty much wasted attempting to get the Estimote, Arduino and Sigfox devices to work, though after about half an hour of brainstorming we quickly cemented our next idea. A lot of challenges required close cohesion between team members, such as the implementation of PHP and databases in the otherwise-jQuery website.I (Simon) am proud that I've managed to hold my own in what seems to be a set of far more experienced peers, and I'm glad to have both made a positive contribution that has impressed my team and even learnt a little bit for myself.I (Simon) learned some jQuery and an interesting little plugin for it, a terminal emulator by the name of ptty. Also, since this was my first hackathon, I also picked up on some tips and put into practice a few hints I'd already learned from articles, the best of which being to never stop until you feel ready to basically just pass out. Within reason, of course.We could update it to make it more stable (though error handling is something we're glad to say Michael implemented very late in the hackathon), and we could also devise more games for it.GreatUniHack Fall 2016Simon Fish

And after spending a decent amount of money there is nothing what you can do with your Blu-ray disc, right? We have a solution to this problem, a recurrent neural network that is able to generate new levels for your game!Based on experience, a set of Mario Bros maps, the network generates new levels. The only thing we require from you is a length of a map as well as the crazy factor. Cause why keep stuff boring?We built this using Keras, a python library for deep learning networks. We first took maps available online, turned them into ASCII representation using OpenCV and then feed the text as the training set for the network. After generating a new ASCII map we turned them again to Javascript format, which is understandable by the version of Mario we are using.At the beginning we were trying to build a network able playing Mario itself, unfortunately we had to leave this one, since it very hard to setup the feedback step. We focused on the generating new maps only.It is working!A better understanding of recurrent neural networks. <3GreatUniHack Fall 2016Grzegorz Jacenków

Our team thought that the task of working with virtual reality, modelling and innovation  was the most suitable so we built upon it.The hack itself is basically set to innovate the way people buy real estate: instead of going to every single location by foot or car, the customer would have the ability to meet with an agent or just view the estate from home with any VR headset. But our project does not just stop there - the main goal is to not only be able to view the rooms, but to actually customize them yourself! You could add any furniture you desire just to have a better feel on how a specific property tailors to your needs! In addition to that, the engine would work in such a way that you only need to implement the type of housing you need (office, flat, etc.), the amount of occupants and the system will automatically generate a room with certain types of furniture in it in a specific formation. The last thing to be implemented would be a machine learning algorithm that actually learns from customers needs and makes better assumptions as to what type of house to offer!The project was build by using a simple piece of hardware and a few pieces of software, that being the the famous Samsung VR gear, 3D modeling software BLENDER and last but certainly not least, the Unreal Engine for the actual mapping of items and surroundings. We decided to use the Unreal engine as it has a really friendly user interface called ""blueprint"" that actually helps minimize the amount of low level code and move building blocks of the program into a more high level environment.During our development path we have encountered quite a few hurdles: the largest of them being the massive struggle with the Oculus rift. The main issue with the rift was that we spent an actual 9 hours trying to get it to work on our laptops. We went to the extent of trying a campus computer to no avail. This automatically led to a loss of precious time, but we managed to get back from it and come back with a bang! The setback did not terminate our drive and we came out with a finished alpha version of the app that we are very proud to present!We manage to deal with the setback from the OCULUS, dealt with numerous errors from Unreal engine, and finally came out with a working product!We have learned a great lesson in teamwork as well as actual software and hardware skills that helped us implement our project!Who knows, the app might one day reach an actual beta version!GreatUniHack Fall 2016Created a back end C++ algorithm to determine the required room size, from the available, and generate the initial layout depending on the number of employees and the work space style. The initial map is then set up for the user to explore and tweak. I had never coded in C++ before, only C; so the differences between the two languages became apparent to me.I created the 3d models for the app and set up Unreal Engine.Applied my knowledge in C++ to aid my teammates in developing the actual project (algorithm). Helped troubleshoot various issues during the project and prepared the Powerpoint presentation.I helped code the back-end algorithm written in C++ and creation of Blueprints in Unreal Engine. This was my first time using Unreal Engine and C++ so I learned a lot about the engine (plus another programming language to stick on the ol' CV).Mantas Navickas

583,GreatUniHack Fall 2016,583,,583,"A speech-to-text adventure with Raspberry PiHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and many other cool text adventures. We were
also very excited to work with Alexa following our previous failed attempts with
other hardware such as the Sigfox board and Estimote - after attempting to make
a device-based hide-and-seek game to no avail, we continued to explore ideas
involving different types of games, including a reaction-based buzzer game,
but the idea of a text-based game in Alexa quickly won it for us.Alexa offers one text-based adventure game dictated between you and your Amazon Echo device, based on our experiences at GreatUniHack 2016, albeit with a little more gruesome death from lack of self-care...if you don't play it right.Initially we experimented with some Bluetooth, GPS and NFC devices with ideas such as a hide-and-seek game and access control for the workplace with some helpful widgets. However, hardware failed us, and we were not able to carry out these ideas, so after a fairly speedy brainstorm we chose to rely on the Amazon Echo for text-based games. The statistics for this are viewable via a web frontend powered by jQuery and PHP, and all information is also retrievable via the Echo, which itself recognises users entered into a database on the website.The first six and a half hours were pretty much wasted attempting to get the Estimote, Arduino and Sigfox devices to work, though after about half an hour of brainstorming we quickly cemented our next idea. A lot of challenges required close cohesion between team members, such as the implementation of PHP and databases in the otherwise-jQuery website.I (Simon) am proud that I've managed to hold my own in what seems to be a set of far more experienced peers, and I'm glad to have both made a positive contribution that has impressed my team and even learnt a little bit for myself.I (Simon) learned some jQuery and an interesting little plugin for it, a terminal emulator by the name of ptty. Also, since this was my first hackathon, I also picked up on some tips and put into practice a few hints I'd already learned from articles, the best of which being to never stop until you feel ready to basically just pass out. Within reason, of course.We could update it to make it more stable (though error handling is something we're glad to say Michael implemented very late in the hackathon), and we could also devise more games for it.GreatUniHack Fall 2016Simon Fish

And that's pretty much the origin of Bomber Goose.It's pretty much a casual game of bomberman. But this time it bombers as geese, Galaxy Note 7 as the bomb, MLH symbol as power up and AstonHack hackingspace as area. For control, just enter the website address on your mobile phone and it will turn it into controller and add you as another player.We are running Amazon server for the main game, with .tech domain to connect to it. Entering bombergoose.tech/player.html on your mobile phone will add you to the game and display mobile controller. Works on both Android and iOS. The area of the game is made from pictures of AstonHack hacking space.Spending countless hours browsing geese pics on internet.Well, we didn't really build linux kernel from scratch. Or create facebook in machine code. But we had fun. We met cool people. We enjoyed every minute of AstonHack and that's what we are most proud of.That hackathon isn't just an event to improve your skills, make projects that will shine on your CV or win challenges. It's mainly about just having fun with other people. It doesn't matter how advanced your project will be, it's about how much you enjoy doing it.It will forever stay in our minds.

                Nov 06, 2016 10:21 AM ESTAt first we wanted to host the SQL database using Crate.io and Amazon Web Services . but we couldn't get that operational. We had in mind a website that would communicate with a backend database; The database has a catalog of films, but if a user names a film not in the database it will run the omdb API that will collect info from IMDB and add that entry to the database.      Also we had user accounts and we had a service running that would manage and allow accounts to be created with forms but we couldn't connect the HTML/PHP with the C# desktop app so the web part of the project was abandoned.    The desktop app does still have users and you can add freinds on the site.   when you add a film to your watched library it lets you give it a rank that we would use to provide recommendations to your friends, And also there was a menu that ran a IP tracing API that found out your approximate post code . with this info we invoked a CinemaFinding API that would run the nearest cinema's to you. The API could also provide now showing information, however this feature is currently deactivated in the API do to a format change.   Lastly we wanted to use our own rating system. For this we used a Twitter mood detector that showed if people posted positively of negatively about the movie and then a screen scraper collected that information. we had a issue about how to then transfer this information into c# and doing so with Live information on request.Log in

Since commits are laid out in time it made sense to use it to sequence sound.It takes a GitHub repository (username/reponame) and plays a drum track based on the commit history of the master branch. When the commits are more frequent it speeds up and vice-versa.I grab data from GitHub's repository API, rescale the timing to make it somewhat drum-like and used the WebAudio API to sequence drum samples.One major problem is that most repositories follow the pattern of big spikes of activity and loads of idle time. That makes the tracks very boring to listen to. I transformed the timings so that it never speeds up or slows down too much.Wrangling the timing in WebAudio is something completely new to me, so I'm happy to have learned more about it. Finding the right parameters for solution to the above problem was also pretty great!Dealing with browser-based audio and the awesome GitHub API.I'm taking it on tour.AstonHack 2016Giedrius Kudelis

The compatability with python and the database was also difficult.It almost worked!

All you need to do is enter your email and their number, and they will very quickly begin receiving Goose related facts every hour for the rest of the day! Every Goose fact has a guaranteed AWFUL Goose pun.We set up an EC2 web app on AWS which allows a user to connect and sign up their friend for Goose facts. We built the site using HTML5 and developed the web app in Python using Flask and Twilio. We also set up a database of numbers, emails and Goose-facts using SQLite. We then send a text using Twilio to all the numbers in the database containing a single Goose fact and pun.Setting up the webserver was hard.
We had trouble adding the numbers and emails to the SQLite database using Python.
Sending all the texts out with Twilio to everyone on the database caused a data passing issue.

The solution was obvious.You can enter text in any language, and it will identify the language, tag the parts of speech, and translate it fluently into Goose. It can be displayed as text or read out loud.The main API I used was called the Words API, where you could send it a word and it would respond with the part of speech for that word (noun, verb, etc.). The front-end was build with HTML and CSS, and the translating was done with PHP.I ran into many challenges, mostly due to lack of experience and severe lack of time. I was only able to attempt to implement a small amount of the features I wanted, and most of the things I did implement ended up not working. With more time I could absolutely get this working, but trying to work with so many new APIs and technologies in a 24h time period was beyond my skill level.I'm proud of both coming up with the idea and getting a decent way along to getting these APIs working, as I've never properly worked with APIs before.I learnt a lot about working with APIs and AWS.I'd really like to actually finish this project. Without the time constraints I can work on getting all the parts working properly. It may seem silly to spend lots of time on a project that literally translates things to squawks, but It would be really nice to have a finished project using APIs that actually works (and hopefully looks good).AstonHack 2016Alex King

Who likes you in secret? Who really hates you? You're in luck, and with just a simple game of Thrisbee™ you can now find out!Pass it round, and see the stats on the cool display and enjoy your metrics!
It'll show you plenty of useful information such as who's passing the Thrisbee™ to whom, who's the most popular, the least, how fair the game is and how much fun you're having!The main micro:bit is mounted on the underside of the Thrisbee™. Each person playing the game then has a micro:bit on their person broadcasting who they are over Bluetooth, and the Thrisbee™ uses the RSSI values of the player's bits broadcasts to determine who's holding it.
The Thrisbee™ then relays the player information and its accelerometer values to a gateway bit connected to a laptop, which gets the data over serial, into matlab which plots graphs and key performance indicators in real time.The Bluetooth link had some issues of reliability when sending more data over the link, and not all data was received and recovered properly. 
We also worked on some mechanics calculations to calculate throw speed, impact, rotations speed and distance thrown, getting promising results but needing more time to implement them fully.We made the Thrisbee™ communicate both with the player's bits and with the gateway bit simultaneously, enabling it to relay which player is holding or throwing it to the computer.
It's also great fun and illuminating in terms of your social standing..We learned a lot about using Bluetooth to communicate between these devices, as well as getting familiar with the mbed platform and microcontroller to microcontroller communication.
We also learned about the limitations of accelerometers and magnetometers, such as limited sampling rates and the importance of signal processing.The next steps are using people's smartphones instead of micro:bits for the detection of who's holding it, and making an app that gets the data over Bluetooth from the Thrisbee™, processes it and shows all the graphs and metrics.
Add a rechargeable battery, embed the microcontroller in an injection molded custom Thrisbee™, pair it with an induction charger and a smartphone app, and sell it to ultimate frisbee teams and anyone who likes fun!CUES Hackathon 2016 Powered by ARMSoooftware[Placeholder Text]Arturo Abruzzini

He realised that novice divers often struggle conveying problems they may be having in the water to their instructor and then they panic.This device reads the student's heart rate, breathing rate and their temperature.
This data is sent to the instructor wirelessly. The data is then analysed and if any of the variables fall outside of a critical range a buzzer is sounded to alert the instructor of the potential danger the student is in.We set out to work out how all of the various components worked with the micro bit. Then we joined them all together on the micro bit and analysed the various inputs to get coherent outputs, which were then further analysed to see if they fell outside of a certain rangeWe first tried to use a peripheral temperature sensor for it's increased accuracy but it was determined that the clock speed of the micro bit made it incompatible
We also were going to interface the system with an android device but were unable to connect the two devices. So we opted for the micro bit -> micro bit interfaceI have never worked with electronics before and so making a working, and potentially useful, device in general was a great achievementWe could fully integrate the system into diving gear, and make it built into the suit and so it would be as easy as wear and go!CUES Hackathon 2016 Powered by ARMJoseph Holland

We often overlook this issue, and by the time we realise it, we have already got fat and unhealthy. Following the recent success of PokemonGo as people stormed out to streets to catch Pokemons, it has inspired us to create a game to encourage programmers to work out more.We have created connection between the BBC:Microbit and a laptop. By attaching a Microbit to yourself, you can play the games on your laptop by moving your body, and hence exercising your body.We used the Python API and radio features of the Microbit to receive gestures on the laptop, and then the data is transferred onto Unity Game Engine (C#).To achieve robust gesture control we had to explore different ways to interact with the Microbit. Also passing strings between Microbits and transferring data via TCP was hard for Python-C#.We have learnt new ways of utilising Microbit data; and discovered how to connect from Microbit to high level applications such as Unity wirelessly.We would like extend the range of exercises that can be done on this platform, such as trainer programs. We would also like to extend into Virtual Reality.CUES Hackathon 2016 Powered by ARMI worked on exploring how to use the Microbit to detect motion and what information to transfer.I worked on building up a robust system of capturing, transmitting the gestures. Debugging and optimisation.I worked on the data transfer between PC server application and Unity application through socket as well as the design and the implementation of game in Unity.Qiuying Lai

After analyzing multiple actions, we could classify newly recorded actions based on the data we collected.We accomplished data collection and transmission with BBC Micro:bit programmed in C++. Three sensor micro:bits sent acceleration data to the main hub micro:bit which had a serial link to a computer. We then imported the data into Matlab for analysis and classification.Using this same method on a much larger sample size would have interesting results. Additionally, attempting to classify a movement as ""good"" and ""bad"" could lead us to give the user feedback on their action.CUES Hackathon 2016 Powered by ARMI worked on filtering out gravity in the accelerometer sensor readings. I also worked on the analysis of the collected data in Matlab and devised a way to align data based on the peak acceleration of the movement.I worked on the USB serial port connection and the data recording interface. Furthermore, I worked on the data analysis in MATLAB, looking at ways of how to extract the main features, cluster the different motions and make predictions.I worked on data collection.

Issuing directions is not always easy, and keeping up with the leader can be even harder - if someone falls behind, it becomes difficult to attract the group's attention to get them to wait.What if there were devices that you could connect together to solve this problem?The device links up to other devices nearby: you select a channel, and specify whether you want to be a leader or a follower. Leaders can press buttons to propagate directions to their followers (left, right, stop), and followers can ask the rest of the group to stop and wait for them if there is a problem.We've been using the BBC microbit as the foundation for this project - we wrote code in python to handle all of the logic, and we soldered switches and a battery pack to the board, as well as a transistor to operate a buzzer.The buzzer could not be connected directly to the output pins of the microbit due to lack of current - therefore, we used a transistor to provide enough current for the buzzer to sound, using one of the output pins to control it.As the hackathon progressed, we added more and more functionality. For example, if someone tries to designate themselves as leader on a channel that already has one, they simply become a guest - we decided to implement this in order to reduce confusion. The buzzer was an addition that we are very proud of - we managed to overcome the problem with our knowledge of electronics in order to still be able to implement this functionality.We all trained our problem-solving skills and got better at coding and digital electronics.CUES Hackathon 2016 Powered by ARMMatteo Pozzi

An idea for a game started to appear......Micro-2048 is a gesture driven 2048 game. The player swipes a Microbit across the air to move the tiles on the screen. It uses radio connection, which means that the player can play it without sitting in front of a computer.We used two Microbits, one is connected to the computer via serial. This then talks to a Node.js server, which relays the sensor information to a browser based javascript game. The other Microbit acts as a game controller, it publishes the gestures it detects through the radio. Together they make a user gesture driven game.We initially had another idea that involved a lot of electronics. Unfortunately, we lacked the components and the experience needed to execute that idea, so we had to switch ideas with only 12 hours left to spare. However, we did manage to successfully pivot and reuse most of our code for a completely different applicationA few of our teammates no little experience with python, but they managed to learn rapidly during the course of the Hackathon and gained a fundamental knowledge by the end of it.We have learnt is that it is much more efficient to start with something with basic functionality and then iterate to make it better, rather than aiming too high from the beginning. Also, it's very important to be flexible and make directional changes when necessary. The most important of all is that we should enjoy the process, and not chase the destination.This project act as a proof of concept that Microbits can bring a completely new experience to gaming. In the future, more games may be powered by the Microbit with more complex gesture drove interfaces.CUES Hackathon 2016 Powered by ARMI wrote the server side app and the embedded python that connected with is using serialI was in charge of electronics stuff and coded in python for some part of this project.Edward Liu

In fact, research carried out by the Department of Surgery at the University of Rochester medical centre found that the elderly over the age 70 are three times more likely to be fatally injured. In many cases, for elderly adults who are frail and have pre-existing medical conditions, what seems like a minor fall can lead to a broken hip or bones. In the scenario that these individuals are alone or cannot easily gain access to someone - this can lead to far reaching and very serious consequences.When a user falls, trips or sustains any significant impact, an emergency call is established with a list of guardians informing them of the user's emergency.The necklace consists of a BBC Microbit, which uses its accelerometer to measure significant impact. When the acceleration exceeds a threshold, the Microbit sends an emergency message via Bluetooth LE to a Raspberry-Pi. The Raspberry-Pi makes an HTTP GET request to our Node.js server, which in turn establishes a call with the guardian of the user using the Twilio Call API.CUES Hackathon 2016 Powered by ARMEvgeny Roskach

Our ability to quickly read emails or just access internet is often essential in our work. And yet still, over 60% of world population doesn't have access to internet. Even we often find ourselves in a position where we either run out of mobile data, don't have any credits on our account or there is no internet connection in our area. We decided to fix this problem with Networkless.Networkless is basically an offline web browser, that allows you to view websites even if you don't have access to internet. All you need is ability to send SMS from your phone and in return you can view any website you want in text version.We built an Android app, which looks similar to a traditional web browser. When you type the desired website into address bar, our app will send it as SMS to Twilio service. Our Amazon based server will then collect the HTML code of typed website, compress it and send the code back to user's phone (again, via SMS).It turned out that the HTML code of websites is usually far too big to fit in text messages. Typical Wikipedia pages contains hundreds of thousands of characters, while typical SMS can contain up to 160 characters. We dealt with it by heavily compressing the HTML file and removing unnecessary parts from it.Improving the compression of html file is our highest priority. It would decrease number of SMS sent for website to load, and therefore, improve app performance significantly. Other features we wish to implement:-saving websites offline

There's a very simple (18 lines of code) back end written in PHP. The front end is stylised using bootstrap.YouTube doesn't allow all videos to be embedded, due to the various different licensing arrangements they have - so I had to make sure my web app took this into account and didn't offer users videos which were unplayable. I designed a bespoke events protocol using pusher to synchronise clients ""peer to peer"" - all the back end does is authorise connections (all connections are automatically authorised, however pusher requires connections to be authorised using a back end before they can broadcast data).Unfortunately my web app doesn't yet work on mobile due to issues with automatically playing / pausing videos (see the YouTube documentation for more information). I hope that this issue can be overcome in the near future.It all works fairly smoothly. The user interface is quite friendly, and is looks reasonably nice. This was my first ""major"" (4+ hours of coding time) project using JavaScript - it's a good way to write cross-platform applications.I learned how to write a substantial application using JavaScript, and how to use Pusher without having a central backend to keep track of state. I think this is really useful - by using client-side programming and peer-to-peer communication costs are kept to a minimum and applications are generally scalable by nature.There are a few items on the to do list. I'd really like to integrate with Spotify instead of YouTube, as Spotify offers greater music choice and higher sound quality. Access to their APIs is by application / invitation only, so hopefully this proof-of-concept can show that this is a good idea.BrumHack 5.0I did it all...Benjamin Howe

With limited time and options, c9.io proved to be a great tool for easily hosting your server on the net.Successfully hosting the server in an online environment with properly working End-Points for the client to useThe database is the bread and butter of the back-end, but even if you have the perfect server, it all depends on the front-end in the end.Finishing up the prototype; implementing the leaderboards; creating more and various challenges; working with students and staff on campus in order to provide the best user experience and content for the beacons.BeaconQuest 2 in 2018BrumHack 5.0Danail Penev

So we came up with the idea of a parking finder!The Android app sends an sms through Twilio to a live website, which, in turn, starts crawling information off the internet with Python.Some of us knew some Java, some of us knew a bit of Python and wanted to experiment with it, and some of us knew almost nothing!The biggest challenge was setting up the Twilio functionality, because we were absolutely new to this technology. We almost quit because we couldn't find the latitude and longitude of an address. Also, the Python crawler wasn't able to gather the information that was generated dinamically, so we had to try several websites, think of multiple ideas... Because in the beginning we actually wanted to do some weird food tinder.The fact that we actually have a final working project!!! But also, it is pretty useful and it's quick enough to be used in real life. So the project is live righ now and the world can actually enjoy the free credit we have from Twilio.So we learned to use Android Studio, for instance how to connect Javascript to XML, of course, Twilio, how to actually run a Python script on a webpage and that stickers actually make a pretty neat decoration for a laptop.To extend it in other cities of the world and to create the possibility of sending a message with the number of the parking in order to receive directions.BrumHack 5.0I worked on that backend for days, but I seriously learned a lot of things! Twilio is great, Python is cool and putting everything together worked like magic.I worked as a front-end developer . I  used the Android Studio IDE in order to make the app. It was a challange for me since it was the first time I worked on an android app and since I have never used XML and Java before.I mainly worked on the Twilio connection of the app, but helped with the whole back-end part.I got involved in using both the java back-end of the app, but also the front-end development using xml. Even if I never used Android Studio before, I managed to get myself used to the IDE.Savu Daniel

Another main problem was communicating the location of walls from the server to the main map.We are proud of the ability to use phones as controllers - this is kind of cool.This was the first time George had used JavaScript, so this was a good opportunity to develop his skills.If we were to continue we could develop the multiplayer aspect further.BrumHack 5.0Made the basic single player game upon which the final game was based, created sprites and other game assets, sourced music and effects.Worked on the back-end server setup, serving the different pages and networking with socket.io.Reece Bennett

The game is controlled by the players' phones (by accessing a control pad on a server) while the game arena is displayed on the main screen.The main game is built using node.js, and the server-phone communication is handled using socket.io (unfortunately Pusher proved inadequate for our purpose).We initially tried to use Pusher to handle our server-phone communication, however this proved impossible for real-time events that we were aiming for. Another main problem was communicating the location of walls from the server to the main map.We are proud of the ability to use phones as controllers - this is kind of cool.This was the first time George had used JavaScript, so this was a good opportunity to develop his skills.If we were to continue we could develop the multiplayer aspect further.BrumHack 5.0Made the basic single player game upon which the final game was based, created sprites and other game assets, sourced music and effects.Worked on the back-end server setup, serving the different pages and networking with socket.io.Reece Bennett

Fear no more! You can manage your containers from the safety of your bed.This app allows you to create, start and stop containers while also allowing you to check the status of the containers, how many are running and if the Docker Hub is up.We used an AWS Lambda to facilitate the communication between the Alexa device and the Docker API that we developed. The Lambda converts the data received from the Docker API to nice messages to play back to the user. There is a conversational element of the app is accomplished by using the session variables in the Alexa Skills Kit.The Docker API was built upon the official Docker Remote API (and Node bindings) with some changes to combine some results and to reduce network overhead by removing unneeded variables. The API runs on a server and the communication was done over https (with a Let's Encrypt certificate).We attempted to create an infrastructure to allow you to log in to the Alexa Skills app to select the server you wanted to administrate. Due to the complexity and time restraints, we could not complete this. This means the server details have to be hardcoded in to the Lambda.We had issues when creating and starting the containers as Alexa would time out. We worked around this by splitting the creating and starting of the containers in to two steps that can be stringed together with a conversational like command. (""create a ... container called ... "" then ""start it"")The whole thing! It's three of the team members first Hackathon and the fourth's second, so it was a great learning experience to complete a working app. We're most proud of the contextual awareness when starting a container.Many of the tools/APIs we used were new to us. We used AWS Lambdas, Alexa Skills Kit and the Docker Remote API for the first time. The project provided a great refresher to JavaScript and Node JS which we only had limited experience with.We hope to add the ability to log in to the app via the Alexa Skills app to select the server you will be administrating. A long term goal would be to add the ability to administrate swarms/clusters.HackSheffield 2.0James Clark

Now Alexa can tell you based on your allergens profile.We wanted to make a skill for Amazon's Alexa. We thought that health-care was an interesting sector. One of our team members has a nut allergy. A common question is ""can I eat ..."". It would be useful if when in your home, Alexa could easily answer this question.This is an Alexa 'skill' that lets you ask if a food is ok for you to eat based on an allergy profile that you make.First, we experimented with different food APIs to see which one would give us enough allergen information. We made a codepen to visualise these API's output.We used AWS Lambda to host the Node.js backend that included the Alexa SDK and a custom wrapper for the food label SDK. We used Firebase DB by Google to store user allergen profiles.AWS Lambda is terrible at giving meaningful errors and also seems to have patchy support for new JavaScript ES6.We were able to pass arbitrary length strings to Alexa and pass the data to an API. This proved quite difficult.Some members learned JavaScript for the first time. We got better at collaborating with Git and Github and learned how to use the Alexa SDK.We'd like to provide more 'sample utterances' so we can interact with it in different and more human-like ways. Hopefully we'll be able to publish the skill.HackSheffield 2.0It was my first time using javascript and AWS Lambda while working on the User-Alexa interaction.I worked mostly on the node backend for the Alexa skill.

Google Trends does not have an API and the embedded link from their own site was completely broken.Being able to buy a meme and make profit off of itStrong team building skills - allocation of tasks and dealing with bottlenecks in plan.Ruby does not work easily on Windows and Google trends does not have an API. Twitter's API is extremely confusing and had to be hacked to get to work. We learnt how to use some Ruby gems (rufus-scheduler,twitter) and to interface with a database through Ruby.Running on a real web server, supporting logins and adding more memes or unrestricting the purchases to all memes. Hosting adverts on the site and creating a paid or ad based app.HackSheffield 2.0I turned the static HTML files into dynamic web pages as erb files. I also participated heavily in coding their controllers, particularly the login system with Twitter. I also helped colin code his database methods as he did not have an IDE, so I proofread his code and ran it.I worked mostly on the front-end, using Bootstrap to build a generic webpage, which was then rolled out to each meme page. I also was part of the pair which figured out how to embed Google Trends onto the webpage; this was much more difficult than anticipated. Once that was set up, we (the front end team) did help with the back-end, particularly with using the Twitter API. We were using the Twitter API to do something (i.e. count tweets) which we had never done before, and that posed its difficulties but we worked it out eventually.I worked on the back end code of our web app.  I coded the low level functions which handled the interactions between our ruby controller an our database.  I used these functions to build more complex functions which calculated basic stock trends and the value of the price of memes.  I also worked on the twitter api which was used to take trending results to power our stock exchange.I worked mostly on the front end, making a basic prototype for the website and then styling it to look nice and be responsive - this was useful later when we needed to shrink the browser window and would allow us to make a website based app easily if we had the time. I also helped with some of the debugging with the Ruby code and trying to work out how to get value data from Twitter trends.Jack Han

Therefore our vision was to design an app that implemented the simplicity of apps such as SnapChat and Instagram while offering a core functionality that can be used by all.Hype allows users to share events that they are hosting or at already, allowing other users to find and see what's popular in real time. All users are kept totally anonymous so you won't have to worry about privacy concerns.Complex algorithms written in Java and NodeJS are used to calculate the locations of events based on where users 'hype' an area. Dense areas with frequent hypes are ranked above other smaller events that users may not be interested in.None of our team had experience with any of the tools we used before the event. We taught ourselves to use them from scratch and crafted something beautiful out of them.With continued development we intend to add many more features such as social interaction as well as sponsored events.HackSheffield 2.0I did a lot of the back-end work designing the web apis and security that we used for our app. I also spent a lot of time providing round the clock tech-support for the front-end team. I was also up working all night making sure it was perfect for today.I worked on the front-end app development in Android Studio, building the user interface of the app, and I made the graphics (icon and logo).I worked on front-end and design. It was my first experience with stuff like that (Java, XML, Inkscape) and I have learned a lot of new exciting things!I worked on the backend services, helped to solve various issues we encountered using NodeJS.

While learning how to use the Alexa's system we were developing a system that communicated with the BlackRock financial information api. This worked well from the start but we had a lot of companies to sort through ().
Once the decision of removing the Alexa Skill from our plan we started developing a web front end that allowed users to request the top x number of companies and list their financial risk.We could not get the Alexa working with our code and we spent a lot of time trying to get things working on it. This reduced the amount of time we had significantly because we though we were close to getting everything working. We still managed to get a visual version of the data produced but it was not the original plan.We have learned that researching as much as possible on new systems quickly and seeing if it is feasible would have helped us out a lot to:

Now you can visualise your interactions on Twitter!The BBC Twitter account.The MLHack Twitter account.The Durham_Uni account.We wanted to use natural language processing for our project and to make a good project we needed a wealth of data which we collect from Twitter. Once we'd gathered some interesting statistics we wanted to make something pretty!A Twitter user name is given by the user and recent posts from that user are used to create a graph of how positive their messages are.When the Twitter username is submitted a socket is opened.  We use the Twitter API to collect recent posts from that user which are then sent of to Google natural language processing API. The result from this is two metrics called polarity (how positive the message contents is) and magnitude (how strong the language used is) as well as a list of mentions of other Twitter users. This information is then sent via a socket connection back to the user where WebGL is used to graph the results using WebGL (via the ThreeJS library).The nature of the Twitter and Google APIs made it very difficult to pass data between the two and then reunite the results with the original Tweets. Half of the team had never used JS before and none of us had any experience with Web/OpenGL which was made worse by the lack of documentation for some areas of ThreeJS.Data makes it reliably from Twitter -> Google -> User and does so relatively quickly. Client side drawing of interactive graph looks great! Despite being build quickly the whole project is built in such a way that we could fairly quickly implement other features (see What's next...).WebGL, Javascript, lots about asynchronous connections and more ninja git shell skills!If the socket connections was held open after the initial data is sent then the user's graph could be updated with new posts in (near) real time. We could also allow for the graph to expand beyond one step away from the original user name entered. More animations for the graph using the huge amount of data available to drive pretty (but also insightful) animations.HackSheffield 2.0I worked on the client side WebGL (ThreeJS) layout and rendering of the graph.Worked on wrangling the backend and the Google Cloud API into a form we could use.I worked on working with the twitter api into something useful and the front endPeter Noble

694,HackSheffield 2.0,694,,694,"A voice-based skill for Amazon´s Alexa designed to help you find the right degree for you.Listening to Alexa we started to think about her potential and tried to come up with a problem for her to solve. We thought back to a couple of years ago for us when we were trying to decide what degree to apply to at University. This proved to be a very difficult choice, as it is for many, and we thought Alexa might be able to help people with that choice in the future.The Degree Finder asks you a set of questions and tries to understand what you enjoy and your personality. Through these inferences Alexa suggests a degree she thinks will be right for you!We used a ""decision-tree"" template to begin to understand how Alexa worked and built from it a small program in javascript that has a total of 16 different Degrees at the end of it.Understanding Alexa was our biggest challenge. We tried a few different ideas and simply could not get her to do what we wanted. Once we finally got an example program working we found an idea that we could adapt to that program and worked from there.Being able to solve our problems that had us stuck for around 6 hours and create a working program, even a simple one, that actually runs on Alexa. We are also very proud of our idea because we think it could be something that could make an impact with future students if developed further.This was our first hackathon so we learned what is fully involved in one and how much fun it can be. We also learned a bit of javascript from messing around with the code and how to deal with problems in a stressful situation.If it could be expanded to over many more degrees and ask many more specific questions we believe it could go on to help future students make their decision an easier one in the future.HackSheffield 2.0I created the programming base of the skill, and make it work with Alexa (after 6h of trying) and I participated in the questions and answers part as well.I added to many of the descriptions of the degrees and worked on doubling the number of degrees she could cover.Borja Leiva

Now you can visualise your interactions on Twitter!The BBC Twitter account.The MLHack Twitter account.The Durham_Uni account.We wanted to use natural language processing for our project and to make a good project we needed a wealth of data which we collect from Twitter. Once we'd gathered some interesting statistics we wanted to make something pretty!A Twitter user name is given by the user and recent posts from that user are used to create a graph of how positive their messages are.When the Twitter username is submitted a socket is opened.  We use the Twitter API to collect recent posts from that user which are then sent of to Google natural language processing API. The result from this is two metrics called polarity (how positive the message contents is) and magnitude (how strong the language used is) as well as a list of mentions of other Twitter users. This information is then sent via a socket connection back to the user where WebGL is used to graph the results using WebGL (via the ThreeJS library).The nature of the Twitter and Google APIs made it very difficult to pass data between the two and then reunite the results with the original Tweets. Half of the team had never used JS before and none of us had any experience with Web/OpenGL which was made worse by the lack of documentation for some areas of ThreeJS.Data makes it reliably from Twitter -> Google -> User and does so relatively quickly. Client side drawing of interactive graph looks great! Despite being build quickly the whole project is built in such a way that we could fairly quickly implement other features (see What's next...).WebGL, Javascript, lots about asynchronous connections and more ninja git shell skills!If the socket connections was held open after the initial data is sent then the user's graph could be updated with new posts in (near) real time. We could also allow for the graph to expand beyond one step away from the original user name entered. More animations for the graph using the huge amount of data available to drive pretty (but also insightful) animations.HackSheffield 2.0I worked on the client side WebGL (ThreeJS) layout and rendering of the graph.Worked on wrangling the backend and the Google Cloud API into a form we could use.I worked on working with the twitter api into something useful and the front endPeter Noble

The user has the ability to move between the three main floors of the millennium point building to see the number of people using each entrance on each floor. The number of people entering is visualised through a circle that expands when more people enter through that entrance. The program also displays if the day or week is a school holiday, an event or during BCU term time. Averages of the people entering is also shown by Day and by week.First we formatted the given data so that it could be loaded into unity. Next we sourced the floor plans for the building to locate the entrances for use in the product. We then created the UI plan and the 3D world to represent the data we were given.The main challenges we encountered were parsing the original data given for the challenge because the data was not always in a consistent format which could be passed easily for use in the unity engine. Labelling the entrances also proved a challenge as some were not clear to see and were not labelled on the floor plan. Creating a GUI similar to the design of Millennium Point also proved a challenge but we created one by comparing the GUI to documents and the Millennium point website.Through the project we were able to create a project that was aesthetically pleasing for the general public but also could be used to display information throughout the year for the different entrances to the building. We are also proud of using game engine technology to visual data to large audiences with data analysing capabilities.We learnt time management skill, delegation of responsibility to maximise the resources available. We also learnt more about using Unity3D and programming in C#.To improve the project for future use we would let it accept more general data files, to accept custom data which we could not do due to the time constraints of the project. We would also implement more advanced data analysis to provide details of trends over time.Hack The MidlandsI mainly worked on analyzing the data given to us for the project in an excel document and finding ways to best visualize the data. I also helped to determine what type days were so that they could be visualized in Unity3D.I worked mainly on the design of the project, creating the UI design whilst also learning the similarities between Java and C#, a language I am unfamiliar with.I was the main programmer on the project; using my experience with Unity3D to bring our vision to reality.Timothy Mortimore

One where you enter an item name from the game and the form returns the description of its stats as well as an image for that item. The other system is one where you give a player name and the region, then if that player is currently in a live game - the form will return who is in the game with that player.We used a website called jsfiddle.net to allow us to try out using javascript in conjunction with html. We used https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods for reference.We didn't plan effectively - which is how we ended up with two separate systems. For each of us, this is our first hackathon so we are all learning from each other and trying to understand what we should expect from ourselves within this time. Also, none of us had used html and javascript before so that was another learning curve - although prior programming experience between us made breaking this barrier down easier than the others.A working lookup of an item's statistics with a background image on the form.

When things got connected, we expanded and got to polish everything up, and spent the rest of the time optimising the poem generation, through choosing the best lines of poems and having them judged by IBM Watson's Tone Analyser.Python proved to be challenging for us since we weren't experienced enough in it. We sometimes spent more time doing trivial stuff that should be accomplished immediately in a comfortable language. Nevertheless, practice makes perfect, and we never got impeded enough that moving forward wasn't an option anymore.We successfully glued together a remarkable number of APIs and functions all in a python script designed to synthesize awe from analytical data. Parsing JSON proved to be easier than expected, APIs credentials and authentication went surprisingly well. We managed to simulate meaningful emotion in the form of a poem from a picture of basically anything.Knowing your tools goes a long way, as well as having a really organised working environment that can support even the most difficult research sessions.Implementing a beautiful web interface for easier access and spreading the word to anyone feeling that their picture isn't worth a thousand words.

We have been considering QR codes to use with this project, so each of the 'players' could scan the codes after they had found one of the places marked by the organiser. However, after some brainstorming, we have decided to allow any of the users to be able to submit a location to find. This way, the first player to find that location would get points. We decided to scrap the idea of QR codes, as these would be too much of a hassle to print out for every user, especially if only one player would be able to use the code afterwards. Instead, a player who finds one of the locations marked has to take a picture of it, and wait for the approval of the original poster of the location. If it is approved, the user is rewarded with 10 points. As the icon of the game if a camera with an arrow through it, we decided to call the points ""arrows"".We have been considering several platforms for the game, but in the end we chose to make the application using XCode in the language Swift, as we had a team member with a lot of prior experience. We also distributed jobs for the rest of us, with one of us sketching and making the design, and one team member researching the back-end database.We ran into several challenges. First of all, finding a good solution for the back-end was difficult without a good understanding of XCode and Swift. In the end, we decided to use a service called Quickblox, with allowed us to create a database and also manage the data in the application. Another challenge we ran into was the time limit, as even though we tried our best to keep working, we had to scrap some features that we had been considering originally, such as having locations displayed on a map, which would have been a nice extra feature, however it was unfeasible given the time we had.Each of us have learned new skills, as we have all been working with tasks we had never done before. Also understanding the importance of communication was important, and I strongly believe we each became closer to each other as friends.If we were to continue developing this application in the future, we would add other features such as preventing users from finding the chosen locations of the same player more than once or twice, to ensure cheating would be difficult. Also, we would implement a map feature, to make locations easier to find around the city, by giving a radius on the map to show hints about where the locations are.Overall, we each enjoyed this experience, and definitely learnt new skills, and just had fun working together generally.Hack The MidlandsVilmos Czeróczky

Looking at tutorials for making games in Java, I stumbled across a tutorial to make a shooter. This was the humble beginnings of AchimQuest, but now it has evolved into something far beyond the scope of that tutorial.AchimQuest is based on classic bullet hell shooters, where one must dodge enemies and their attacks while trying to survive. This version of AchimQuest features four levels plus one boss level (featuring a surprise boss!), in addition to the ability to change characters whenever you want.As mentioned earlier, AchimQuest initially started as a Java tutorial online. However when I received positive feedback from my peers, I decided to continue with AchimQuest and make it into a fully fledged game. I used my knowledge of Java graphics (awt and swing) to create a proper GUI and made more use of keyboard presses to increase functionality.Java graphics are extremely fiddly, as I found out. Most of the bugs I encountered were usually due to something not being painted or made visible at the right time.I am most proud of the boss fight, which was coded much more blindly (the boss moves differently to the other enemies and is the only one who can fight back, as well as the only one who can withstand a large amount of hits, and change his movement appropriately when hurt).I learned some basic game development techniques which will surely come in useful later on in my career. I also dabbled in audio and image manipulation within Java.If I continue to work on AchimQuest I could perhaps work on special attacks, multiplayer (co-op) and advanced attack patterns.Hack The MidlandsI did everythingGeorge Kaye

The tools we have today for searching the Bible are great, but they are largely keyword and topical search based, which makes it infeasible to ask questions in natural language form about issues important to people's personal lives (i.e. culturally relevant questions), which may not appear in the Bible in direct language. We need a new search engine to enable anyone to ask a culturally relevant question and get a meaningful response directly from the Scripture. This would do 2 things: help Christians grow their faith and be an evangelistic tool for non-Christians who have little or no Bible knowledge. Done right, with the right resources, it could be one of the best tools for understanding what the Scripture really says.Slack channel: prj-askgod

When I press the button it connects over wifi, and tells my prayer buddy that I'm praying, via an app on their phone.Swift v3 iOS iPhone app, and the AWS Button talks to the AWS IoT service, which triggers an AWS Lambda, which talks to the Go backend hosted on Pivotal Web Services (PaaS), and using a AWS SimpleDB database.We'd like to enable church communities to use this with prayer buddies so all they need to do is hand out pairs of devices. We want it to be possible to use this to do anonymous prayer buddies too. We have started looking into buttons that will work on cellular networks and vibrate when the buddy prays. And we'd like to expand the app so you could look at your prayer history, and we'd like to add incentives to bring you break to praying when life gets on-top of you.While smartphones have increased the connection we have with each other through social apps, and made it easier for us to carry a Bible with us everywhere. They can get in the way of quality time with God.As an example: Sometimes I'll think ""Oh I should check-in with my buddy and pray for them"" and I get my phone out to shoot them a message and then get distracted by an Facebook notification.We wanted to tell our prayer buddies that we're praying, without needing to interact with our phones.Praying icon by Cristiano Zoucas from the Noun ProjectCode for the Kingdom Bay Area Hackathon 2016Building the Backend API and IoT Button IntegrationBuilding the iOS appLeigh McCulloch

When I complained to God about this, I felt Him saying ""You do it.""  Since then we've developed a website and recorded over 150 meditations that we believe will have a powerful impact on believers as they meditate on God's Word.While we might have good intentions to meditate on God's Word, too often we get distracted, lose focus and our thoughts wander.  Ocean's Deep Encounters gives you 8-10 minutes of guided meditation with prompts as well as silence for you to personally interact with God.  It helps keep you focused and on track in your time with God.While the website is mobile friendly, the meditations do not advance on such platforms as iPhone and iPad.

Answer basic questions and respond with topical information and verse lookup via the WeChat messages app.Begin by subscribing to the Gospel Guide bot on wechat. The bot responds with a welcome and instructions. Commands such as Start, Stop, Next, allow the user to begin a new 14 day intro to the Bible reading plan. The bot will auto send you todays reading each day and keep track of what reading your are currently on. The bot also accepts voice commands using WeChat's built in voice recognition. The voice recognition currently only works for mandarin Chinese, however our app is multilingual and can accept these Chinese voice commands without issue.In addition to the reading plan, users can ask basic questions such as 'What is God like?', 'Who is Jesus?', 'Who is the Holy Spirit?', and 'What is love?'. Questions that do not have automatic responses are forwarded to another WeChat user who can send a response back. This person could be a pastor or spiritual leader. The bot is also able to receive voice message responses.The Gospel Guide bot can respond with Bible text lookups. Simply send a message containing a Bible verse, chapter, or range, and the bot will send you the full text. If you would like more information about a verse or passage you can send a mesage containing keywords such as 'explain', 'I don't understand', 'commentary' followed by a scripture passage and the bot will send you a link to a Bible commentary on that passage!We built the Gospel Guide bot using Python, Flask, and Redis running on a Heroku.com server.Overall, the coding went smoothly. The biggest issue we had was understanding the limited WeChat documentation on message passing. Because the documentation was translated from Chinese, many questions we had were left unanswered and were solved through trial and error. Other challenges included bugs from working with utf-8 characters and handling the different use cases for text messages, video messages, and audio messages.We built a working Chat bot!I (Ben) learned Python this weekend, thanks to the help of Femi!More Chinese integrationCode for the Kingdom Bay Area Hackathon 2016Ben Dahl

2) Allows teachers to add their custom lessons in the online Editor and push it to their kids devices or to the world.During C4TK hackathon, we wanted to create a completely new lesson with Carmen who has never used our app and our Editor before.  She and Camil managed to add this lesson in less than 1 day, and do it all in Spanish - this is our first lesson in Spanish!!Also, we added ability to add animated Spine objects to a timeline of the animated story, to start their animation in the proper time of the voiceover audio.App is built with Unity

We have a service that allows teachers to independently create lessons for the targeted group of kids and communicate the Message in the most relevant way for those kids/teens.Our Editor requires a lot more work to improve it's usability for teachers.Fix bugs in the Editor & add tests for it.

The best way to prevent pollution is to predict PS failure.To solve the real life problem which can improve my analysis skillsThree correlation factors are found and analysed, which are water level variations, running period of pumping station and power consumption distribution.Firstly, the water level variations data is calculated, these type of data are sufficient. By compaying the normal pattern with abnormal pattern of pumping station, the trend of blockages can be identified.Then, the running period is developed. because if the blockages enter into the pumping station, the operation time will be significantly increasing.Last, the power consumption of pump, is another important factors which can be used to predict the failure of pump station.Understand the data, I have asked many questions to find the right data,many thanks to the kind staffs.Some important data are not available, for example, normal running period data and hourly power consumption data.The model is effective, it does forecast the blocakge which can prevent the pollutions in advance.The whole pumping station, the seweage system.Model improvement, the model is for example, each pumping station has its own model, which should be built individually.Predicting pollution incidentsYapeng Li

Being discriminated against for being who you are and being denied access to bathroom and other services because of that was something we were not too fond of. We took it upon ourselves to help out members of this wonderful community, more specifically those who are homeless and tech savvy, and created something that is so simple to use in an attempt to connect them to services that they seek.Our app connects those without wifi-access to gender neutral restrooms and charging outlets nearby. All that the user has to do is text our phone number.We built our services using twilio, api.ai and different apis we used from sites like refugerestrooms.org and google places. We then integrated intents within api.ai and connected them to our twilio phone number that would then bring about information from the cloud in heroku which sent back information from refugerestrooms.org and google places.Training our intents was a bit difficult for there are millions of ways that an interaction can take place between our uses and our bot. Also, connecting places nearby with users in need, and training our bot to know whether an establishment is open or not took some digging.We are proud to be able to to reach out and impact that lives of those in deed. Although it may not be in a large scale yet, i feel honored that i can create something that can touch and impact so many people who are in need, in a positive effective way.I learned that you dont have to relate to anything or anyone in particular to lend a helping hand. At the end of the days we are all humans, created equally and we should strive to always help those in need. There is nothing more rewarding than to be able to create something that can benefit the lives of others'.We started LooBoot 2 weeks prior to demo day. With such little time on our side, we have created an MVP that touches solely on gender neutral restrooms and phone outlets nearby for those needing this service. We plan on growing and expanding our service by integrating shelters, housing accessibility, soup kitchens and much more.Hack4Equality 2016 Live Demo (Los Angeles)Marlon Lopez

Naturally, we clicked on #HB2 on Twitter, expecting to browse through personal perspectives shared online; to our disappointment, we only saw coverage by national media outlets and personal narratives were few and far between. This is due to Twitter’s algorithm prioritizing crowd traffic over individual voices and the same phenomenon is seen across the modern media landscape. This made us interested in creating a impact sharing platform designed to feature individual LGBT voices.The more we brainstormed the idea, the more we realized the potential value these shared stories could have as a vehicle for political advocacy—so we began to investigate how we might introduce advocacy features into the app. As we aimed to improve on what’s available today, we examined the shortcomings of advocacy organizations and platforms like the Human Rights Campaign and the White House’s We The People. We saw that we could create a more agile, strategic and purposed tool for LGBT personal advocacy.Speakout provides consumer-facing apps that empower citizens to share their personal stories and see the personal stories of others who are impacted by LGBT legislation. Through the app, it amplifies their voices and also encourages them to contact their elected representatives.The server also provides API access that could provide valuable insight for NGOs interested in the perspectives of everyday LGBT people whose perspectives provide valuable research.Eddie designed the wireframes, built the iPhone application using Swift, and built the server and API using Firebase as the backend. Leonard developed the Android app. We stayed in regular contact so we could collaborate on the broader mission and make sure our respective projects aligned.We ran into many technical challenges (implementing authentication, connecting to the backend, parsing data).We also ran into challenges deciding how to our users could present themselves on the app. For political advocacy, it is often most effective to have official names and official addresses on petitions. But for many in our community, official names may not be how we see ourselves, and sharing their addresses may impact their safety. For this reason, we have made it open-ended what people can choose to share.We’re proud of completing two apps, creating a server, implementing live data from the Sunlight Foundation and Google’s Civic API -- and in less than 9 weeks!Leonard learned a lot about Android development, including implementing fragments, implementing images and interacting with servers.We would love to work directly with an LGBT rights organizations (domestic or international) interested in gaining the perspective of LGBT people on a specific issue, then use Speakout to empower that community to be heard.Hack4Equality 2016 Live Demo (Los Angeles)Eddie Chen

On his profile picture he had ""Ask me about sexual health information"". He later explained that sometimes he has to balance 3 phones just to keep up with the message and that it would great to have a tool to help with that. I thought the idea was ok at the time but chose to join another team. Then I woke up one morning with an idea that would not leave me.  ""This guy is saving lives and slowing down the spread of STI's and STD's "" And that is awesome!!How could he connect to multiple users on device? How could he connect with multiple users on multiple platforms on one device? How does he know all the information that he needs to know? How does he access this information? Does he ever get tired of answering the same question over and over? Can his time be used more efficiently? How does he get the resources he needs to the right people? How much does he know about the person  in order to give them relevant information? How does the person stay private and comfortable to ask the questions? How does he reconnect with users and alert them- or inform them of valuable information? And how can we make this cool enough that it takes the taboo out of  chatting about Sexual Health.  Frankly, is there a better way. Needless to say, thought would not leave my head.  And that is how HeyBud came about.HeyBud is  ""non-judgmental and chill"" hybrid (AI and Human powered) chat bot to answer sexually related questions, present users with access to health-related resources and automate complex on-boarding paperwork/processes required for health treatment.--To the user it is a familiar chat application that happens to know a lot about sexual information.-- To a counselor it is so much more: behind the scenes - when the chatbot can not answer a question or if a ""red flag"" is raised during the conversation- the conversation is automatically rerouted to a counselor who fits the skillset of what is needed to help the individuals.-- Additionally the counselor is connected to valuable ESRI and Grindr resources to better understand the person and provide them valuable visual feedback.Sweat, Prayers and Tears
Unfortunately, we lost some team members  due to day-to-day work overload and the immensity of this project. Therefore, Savalas had to build the back-end systems  (on AWS Serverless, PHP, MySQL and Firebase) and the client apps (iOS, Facebook Messenger). Savalas first pitched a slide presentation to his mentors to get their buy-ins. He then gathered relevant information to test the project feasibility. He then put together the architecture with designs. 
And the building began. With Prayers Savalas reached out to his friend Eddie to have him put together a video vision that would explain how HeyBud is ""the friend you always had""-- We lost team members
-- We also are trying out cutting edge technology like serverless and  SpeechKit.
-- The area is so new to us that it was somewhat challenging to gather information from mentors. Fortunately, they were great to work with and review our script and directions on multiple occasions.Proud to see the vision to come into fruition. Very proud of the product because we believe that we can save multiple live and livelihoods with HeyBud.

769,Hack4Equality 2016 Online-Only (Global),769,,769,"raTe is a review platform for finding healthcare that’s trans* friendly and to be able to avoid healthcare that’s notHealthcare should be equally accessible for everyone. Today that’s not the case.
Trans* people face a larger risk of discrimination, bad treatment and trans unawareness in the healthcare system because of professionals lack of knowledge, and also problematic attitudes and unawareness towards trans people. This is a reality for our trans friends, lovers and the trans community that we’re closely connected to. We hope to be a part in giving the power and possibility to find healthcare that matches ones needs, and avoid healthcare that don’t.Mina has been working with LGBTQI issues for the last ten years, both voluntary, as elected and as an employee. Minas main focus in their work has been hiv/STI-prevention, sex education and trans health and rights. Björn has been working with programming, web design and user experience for almost 20 years. Both of us are activists and a part of the LGBTQI-community in Stockholm and Berlin. The challenge for trans persons of finding good an avoid bad healthcare is something that we've experienced very close. We decided that if we combine our knowledge and experience, we mabye could add a little contribution to the work with conquering this challange.With the digital service we've developed, our aim is to:We’re really hope that this service can be used by people in the entire trans community, and also mabye by trans allies who want to choose healthcare where trans people get a good treatment.'* In this context, trans is used as an umbrella term to refer to people whose binary or non-binary gender identity and/or expression differ from the sex they were assigned at birth. The term trans in this context includes, but are not limited to, people who are ftm/transmasculine/trans men, mtf/transfeminine/trans women, non binary, genderqueer, two spirit and gender non-conforming people.The service we've developed gives trans people the possibility to review health care facilities based on one's own experience, both by rating and in free-text reviews (something like trip advisor, but about health care and just for trans people. For people moving to a new city, or just wanting to find a trans friendly endocrinologist, hiv/STI testing facility, gyneacologist or General Practitioner, we hope that this platform can be a big help.Filters can be applied to narrow down the search to the kind of healthcare, and reviews from people with a certain kind of sexual orientation and trans experience. For example you can search for clinics that prescribes gender confirming hormones reviewed by people who are transsexual, or hiv/STI-clinics that have got reviews by gay trans guys.This platform will hopefully be used globally, the outspoken aim is that it should be used in several different countries. A clinic appears on the platform as soon as someone reviews it, independent on where it is located. Since one of the challenges we want to facilitate solving is finding the healthcare providers you need when moving to a new country, which quite often can be an obstacle for people who for example need to find somewhere to get hormones and check up values, find a hiv/STI-testing clinic where you can feel safe as a trans person.The work has been done in close connection with or network of trans friends, family members and lovers, as well with the trans community and individuals at trans/LGBTQI NGO:s (TGEU, ILGA Europe and The Swedish Youth Federation for LGBT Rights). The work process has been:The main challenge we have experienced is the distribution of the prototypes and getting actual reviews. We get lots of positive feedback about the project and that this platform is something that people has been longing for and really think is needed. The amount of reviews that we have gotten so far does however not correspond with the positive feed back we have gotten. A part of this is probably that it feels less inspiring to send in feedback in a prototype where you don't know what the end result will be, than giving reviews on a platform that's online and working. But one challenge has definitely been to get people to do actual reviews, and not only saying that it's a really good and needed project.Another challenge has been to find a balance between how much background info you want to have about the reviewers, and how much details to ask about in the review function. For some people, lots of details are good, both about the reviewer and the clinic. On the other hand, some people don't think it feels good to be asked to much questions about yourself, and too many questions in the review function can be a big barrier for giving a review.How to be correct with all rules concerning storage and display of personal data was a field that was new to us, and that at firs felt like quite a bit of a challenge. But after communication with The Swedish Data Protection Authority (our servers are based in Sweden) and checking up European and international legal system concerning this field, we feel that we're safe and know what we're doing.We're really proud about having spoken and gotten feedback from so many people in the target group and with organizations working with sexual health and trans rights and health. All in all, we've reached out to approximately 200 people so far, which feels like a big accomplishments. We're also happy for having gotten our work mentioned in national Swedish radio in a program with about half a milion listeners. And at last, we're really proud about all the positive feedback we've gotten from individuals, NGO:s, our network and other parts of the trans community.We learnt lots in the work with the different prototypes of the review form and all the feedback we got through it. Individuals that have given us feedback have lots of different views, sometimes totally contradictory. Trying to find ways to fulfill the wishes for as many as possible has been a rewarding challange.Since we really wanted to be sure that everything we do is in line with applicable laws, we've learnt quite a bit about the legal system around data use and storage. Another technical stuff we learnt was programming with the Google map API.On a personal level, we've learnt about working together, something that was new to us. We've known each other for several years, but have never worked in a project together before.First of all, we of course hope that the platform will make it easier for many trans people to find good healthcare, and that it will be widely known within the trans community. As mentioned before we have been in contact with several trans and LGBTQI organizations/networks in the making of the platform. One future possibility we see for the platform is that any of these take over the administration of the platform. Also other actors could be in question for taking over the platform and the administration of it. The most important thing for us is that the actor has approach, values and attitudes in line with ours as well as deep knowledge about trans issues, and that the motives for taking over the app not is just commercial but also ideologically based.Another future alternative for the platform is that we continue to administer it ourselves, and to look for some funding for the administrative work with and distribution of the platform. Another way of sustainable funding could be to offer education to health care services in need of improving their trans competence in countries and regions where there don't exist good trans/LGBTQI education programs for health care services.With the technical solution, we see several developement possibilities. A push notification when leaving an adress where google has a clinic listed is something we have been discussing. Technical integration with Grindr, where for example  high-rated clinics for hiv/STI-testning shows on the search grid or come sup as a pop-up when being close, are other possible functions for further development that we have been discussing. Another thing we've been thinking of is to extend the target group for the platform to involve the entire LGBTQI-community. Even though trans people most often face challanges with finding suitable health care, other parts of the LGBTQI-community also struggle with this challenge from time to time.Hack4Equality 2016 Online-Only (Global)Mina Gäredal

By comparing institutes to their own history has allowed us to get a good idea of when their behaviour is unusual and should be investigated for potential savings.The outputs from this was a dashboard document which shows just a small amount of the information that can be gleamed from the data available and by using exactly the same data and approach a notification system can be implemented to get quick notification for issues.The solution was built using an Azure SQL Database for data storage and transformation. Tableau was then used to visualise this information. From there a dashboard was created to show the real insight from the data.Energy management reports for local authoritiesDaniel Reed

There is no system integration – utility data and council data are not combined.
Visibility is an issue – lack of rich, human accessible information.
Operational issues are not highlighted as quickly as they could be and energy managers require genuine insight and  intelligent prioritisation,  live alerts and easy to digest data.Goals:
Improve efficiency – You can only measure what you can see
Work in partnership with sites (or in reality customers) to save water and money, and protect the environment.
Educate building managers, business managers, caretakers and end-users by providing better and more accessible information and advice through harmonised data.
Promote awareness and measure the success of water-saving initiatives.
Facilitate investment to help organisations make further savings in their water use and their bills.Approach:
Develop an application that provides visibility of usage patterns and problems to help improve operational efficiency and save money.
Dashboards and visualisations of the data – including smart site health ratings and intelligent prioritisation. This takes the data admin load away from staff and allows them identify smart strategies that are proactive rather than reactive.
Using gamification to bring site managers and wider stakeholders along with the strategy via a campaign (ultimately multi utility).We built:
One key area we wanted to address was the lack of data availability that had been seen time and time again in council systems. We looked to address this issue by basing our development on top of a high availability RESTful JSON API. This approach will allow us to provide data to the dashboard and to create the poster in near real time, whilst also opening up the data to facilitate future hackathons, to aid further insight and cost cutting in the future.We we're able to expand the functionality of the API to provide it's first signs of insight by ranking the best preforming schools. This showed that the newer schools were more energy efficient. Proving investments in new systems are already starting to pay off.Summary:
Visibility and therefore visibility are the major issues
You can’t measure what you can’t see 
Water is the worst but provides biggest opportunity
Improve efficiency at top level gamify site level and wrap in campaignMoving forward:
Multi utility – bring data sets together
Any site, any style
Can be used to validate business investmentEnergy management reports for local authoritiesIan Birtwistle

Integration – Enforce ownership of datasets to drive more efficient process.
Reporting – Start categorising sites so they can be compared against benchmarks
Ownership – Push reports to building owners for them to take a vested interest and ownership of efficiencyBuilds reports for building managers on receiving the NWL data and fires alerts to energy/asset managers
The underlying function of this development is to unload some of the efficiency drive work from the energy manager and empower building management to take ownership and give them a purpose to drive through change themselves.Plenty of scope for future development in this area
Use of Power BI to create interactive reporting and dashboards for management.  Technology in use is already closely coupled to enable this to happen.
Dynamically connect Tech Forge and System Link
Apply targets and track these

Just write him what you need to see or which widgets aren't needed anymore via your computer or mobile phone and it will automatically update your board.For the frontend we're using a websocket connection to get data pushed from the server. This data is used by react.js to update the grid reactively.On the one hand all of us use Slack at work everyday and we all enjoy playing arround with one of the many different bots aviable, or even with our own ones. 
On the other hand we were looking for an easy configurable dashboard to use in the office or even at home. 
So we had the idea to combine both and build a dashboard editable via Slack. 
In the office colleauges could share current activities or funny gifs with easy and short commands.
At home the dashboard can be used to coordinate te everyday life with your flatmates, for exammple with a shared grocery list.In the future we will probably start using Dashbot at home and so find out about missing features and weaknesses in the current controlling. For working on project in the future we will probably rewrite the code using sailes with our newly gained knowledge and experience.
The goal for the future is to see Dashbot running in the office.HackSussex2016Niklas Riekenbrauck

Many events are sometimes discovered on Facebook by accident when someone clicks ""attending"" or ""interested"" in an event.FootFall is a platform that allows users to visualise the hottest events happening around them. They can search for different locations around the worldWe first gathered data using the Facebook graph API and sorted the data based on location, event dates, duration of the events, and the estimated number of people attending. An API was then created to query this data, which allows to then present in any client we choose. Our data visualisation method of choice is the Google Maps API, which allowed our users to interact with events that they found using a heatmap and a filter for the events based on date ranges. We deployed our website to Amazon AWS and also used a custom domain from Domain.com. On the AWS instance, have an Apache server for serving web content and a node.js server for API calls. We'd like to thank the sponsors of HackSheffield as well as the organisers of the hackathon for running this amazing event.The biggest challenge we ran into was gathering the data itself. We had to be careful to not breach any terms of privacy and it was a major concern to us that there wasn't enough data around as well.We are proud of solving a Big Data problem. Making sense of the data that we had and presenting it in a visually pleasing interface while also using it to benefit potential users around the world is truly satisfying. The team dynamic is also something that we are truly proud of. We enjoyed building something cool that matters during the hackathon.We learnt how messy data is presented to us and sometimes, we don't even realise that there is data that we can utilize in a useful manner useless we actively looked for it.We could implement other sources of data, for example, live tweets from Twitter regarding current events and intergrate that into our platform. We could also allow our users plan a route through popular events in their area to help them discover the events around them.HackSheffield 1.0I was responsible for mostly the front-end parts of the project, using HTML and CSS during the hackathon. I also implemented part of the Google Maps API, including the using the Places API, implementing the search box, and helping to add the heatmap to FootFall. I learnt a lot about jQuery during the hackathon and how it can be implemented into projects.I coded a bit of everything in this project from using python with Facebook graph api in order to come up with a way to get listings of public events to the nodejs backend API to the front end HTML, CSS and jQuery. I learnt a great deal about the Google Maps API during this hack.We created an extremely useful and usable product in just 24 hours which is an incredible achievement! I learned a lot about many aspects of web application design, including utilising Google and Facebook APIs, lots more about JavaScript, how to set up a server with AWS and how to transfer files to and from the server.

YeayA bit confused???Learning!!Sensor data from real world can be extremely noisy. Trying to make sense of tens of thousands of entries manually is NOT an option. Our approach uses different techniques to map the entries to the proper activities.Initial dataset has many instances that are mislabeled. 
We use a rule-based pre-processing routine to filter the meaningless data points.
A simple neural network is then trained to classify the entries into 6 categories:
IN_VEHICLE, ON_BICYCLE, STILL, UNKNOWN, TILTING, WALKING
The final goal is to visualise this new, improved information on a front-end.The data is in CSV format, the pre-processing is done using simple python scripts and subroutines.
The neural-net is written in python and is an input layer directly fed into an output layer. 
Activation function is a simple max function. Noise was introduced to try to reduce the effect of the skew in the classes composing the dataset.The dataset, being real-world sensor data, was skewed towards certain activities.
This means that some classes were overrepresented during the learning process and dominated the network.There is [a certain degree of] learning from the network and the visualisation shows that pre-processing is useful to a certain extent.Expect some serious noise in real world-data, sensors are cool but take them with a pinch of salt.

We tried to build a game that extracts questions and answers from raw data.It uses some data set that contains information about countries, capitals, cities and population. Questions are gathered without knowing the structure of the data using some kind of Data Analysis. After getting the questions and answer, the game that we built in Unity fetches the questions from web server in AWS and users can answer them by just hand gestures received by Leap Motion.We used AWS to store data and the web service that gives the questions. Unity 3D 5.3 for building the game and Leap Motion of course. PHP and MySQL for implementing a web server that outputs in json.We tried to build it in Windows first, after 6 hours of coding for the game in Unity it completely failed. So we started from scratch with Mac. After spending couple hours of more efficient coding, Unity in Mac froze and we lost all our design except C# codes. We spend couple hours just to find an appropriate data set.Although we didn't have any handful experience in Unity 3D or C#, in less than 24 hours we built a functional game with some complex features as getting data from a web server asynchroniously and Leap Motion which we also tried for the first time here.We definitely learned Unity 3D with C# development. Some web services and data analysis.To sum up, the fact that we mainly focused on auto generated questions is because we will not need update questions occasionally, instead we will update question generator algorithms, so we can target all kind of people rather than just kids by customizing question types.HackSheffield 1.0Worked on backend and data analysis.Mainly worked on visualisation part of the game.Hikmat Hajiyev

Everyone is using a bookmarks system (usually the browser integrated one), but most of the time the old links (even important ones) are forgotten and they get burried in the massive list of bookmarks.Our web platform takes an URL input from the user and it automatically categorizes, by analysing the english words and it assigns them to different topics (such as Art, Business, Home, Techology) using public classifiers. Also, it displays the most visited websites and a trend of the website categories which are most visited. A system such as this will be really useful for tracking the online browsing and make efficient use of online resources.We used php for back-end and html and css for the front-end. For the classification algorithm we used uclassify and heroku for deployment.We firstly decided to use Python instead of PHP, but unfortunately we had to change our minds and that made us run out of time. Also, as the sun rised, the long time with no sleep had a word in out focusing ability, but coffee and short naps solved the problem.-Have a running platform for the demo

Mobile devices have become ubiquitous as easily accessible and multi-functional portable computers. These devices, having access to a wide array of sensors (such as cameras, gyroscopes, gps, etc.) are capable of quickly providing various types of data to websites.However, when using our desktops to browse the internet, we are incapable of accessing all of our phone's functionality! We cannot utilize the extra screen space of our phone, nor can we provide data from our phone's sensors to the website. Hence, we came up with the idea for a service that could link the functionality of mobile devices with traditional full-size computers. (And we named it AquaPoodle because why not?)AquaPoodle Transfer (hence referred to as APT) is our proof of concept for a web service that can take data from a mobile device and provide it to a desktop or laptop computer in a simple and accessible manner. To allow a user to send data from one device to another, there are three primary steps:The actual implementation of APT is fairly involved. Here we will break down the primary steps into the actual code involved.Establishing a linkage:
Ensuring that the user's mobile device and computer are linked requires a lengthy process of developing a unique session ID and then passing it from the computer to the mobile device with a QR code. To achieve, this, the unique ID must traverse the hierarchy of the code, from the web service down to the mobile device.To begin the external web service generates a unique ID hashed from the mac address of the computer, the current time, and an internal device counter. The user will utilize a chrome extension that will then receive the unique ID. From there, the external web interface develops a QR code based on the URL that the mobile device will navigate to, and the unique ID. The QR code is then provided to the chrome extension. The user then scans this QR code with their mobile device's camera. At this point, the chrome extension and the mobile device both have the same unique ID.Prompting the mobile device:
Prompting the mobile device to provide some data, in this case a photo, is achieved by navigating to a URL that contains javascript that provides the appropriate prompt. This URL is contained in the QR code referred to earlier. Here, assuming an android device is being used, the user may choose to provide a photo in the mobile device's storage, or to take a new photo. In either case, the photo is sent via a post to the server, which then caches it.Sending data to the computer:
Finally, the server can take the cached photo data (here encoded in base 64) and send it through a post to the user's chrome extension. The chrome extension then decodes the photo data and displays it in the toolbar to then be used where appropriate.SO MANY PROBLEMS PLEZ HALPWe ran into an inane number of issues over the course of our 24 hours of coding, which are compiled here:Although we learned tons about javascript and server hosting, our most important development was how to work as a team. Splitting the workload efficiently, organizing meeting times and working together with synergy was highly rewarding and essential to our success.One early example we envisioned was to display a user's shopping cart for a given webpage on their phone, and then allow them to select items from the phone shopping cart to navigate to the appropriate webpage on their laptop or desktop. Given the chance to extend APT, we would like to work on extending the functionality to be more generalized, and at a further point in development, make an API of this code to provide more possibilities with sharing data between mobile and full webpages, so that the first idea could be possible.HackSheffield 1.0Nicholas Goldstein

The user would have a first person VR experience of the robot while controlling it with ""driving gestures"" using the Myo armband.The myo armband can classify several different hand gestures, which are fed into an arduino mega. The recognised  gestures are then converted into directions that the robot should follow. These are passed onto the motor controller which drives the corresponding motors. Finally a camera mounted on the front of the vehicle provides a live FPV which is sent over skype to a control computer.We started by building the chassis of the robot and connecting the wheels. Next we programmed the motor controller to power either the left or right side motors. After this we calibrated the myo armband and developed arduino code that extracted the different gestures using Myorduino available on the Myo Market. The camera and live feed were set up via Skype. Finally all the parts were integrated on the chassis.Firstly we hoped to use an oculus rift to provide the FPV however, none of our computers met the minimum system requirements to run the oculus rift.Additionally we were hoping to use a wifi module to communicate with the arduino over wifi. There were several problems with this approach. Firstly trying to update the firmware on the module proved far too problematic. Secondly we could not connect to the local wifi with the wifi module as we needed special administration permission.We were lacking in hardware and had to use leftover bolts and wires from shop floors.Lack of experience working with the new hardware and most programming languages meant a limited amount of features of the myo could be communicated to the Arduino due to inability to edit the source code of the Myoduino.Integrating the myo armband to control the movement of the vehicle while having no knowledge of the myo prior to the project.. 
Getting the microcontrollers to communicate with each other and making use of the limited hardware that was availableBasics of developing for the myo.
Understanding of the myoduino (interaction between Arduino and myo)
How gesture extraction works.
OpenCV is problematic on windows
oculus rift has high system requirements
How to get communications running between two micro controllersTo make the robot fully wireless and controllable via odroid.
Add semi autonomy in the form of an ultrasonic sensor so the robot doesn't crash.
VR FPV once we can control the robot wirelessly from a desktop computer
Increase the complexity of gestures that the robot recognizes and removal of the delay between input and output to add advanced control.HackSheffield 1.0Learned the basics of myo. Worked with integration of the myo, Arduino and myoduino. Attempted to increase functionality of myoduino but unfortunately was not able to due to inexpeince in coding and no knowledge of myo prior to project. Also attemped to work with Oculus but failed due to hardware specification.I developed the initial code to extract the different gestures from the myo armband to the arduino. I learnt a lot about how the myo armband classifies different gestures based on which muscles are being activated in the fore arm.Attempted to develop the code for the camera/ Oculus to find that the Oculus would not work with the hardware and that OpenCV doesn't work well on windows (am now very good at adding libraries to various compilers), so found a method to broadcast the camera feed. Also did some of the hardware.Hardware and motor control code. (C++)Daniel Lim

The frontend is predominantly built on the HTML5 canvas together with JavaScript.Generating an appropriate image for the cards since the name and link of the image were deeply nested in the JSON objectThe final end productCoding skills, especially the trouble of working with strings in Python 2; the set up process of heroku service and subsequently deploying the app there.As the current working game is generating cards based on a pre-defined list of article titles, the next goal to work towards would be to populate such a list randomly, which was always our intention if we had more time. Further, the game could potentially be made into a multi-player game or a single player game where the player competes against an AI computer player.HackSheffield 1.0I worked on the backend of the game which provides an API for populating the data in each Wiki Trumps card, as well as providing a hosting environment (server) for the game to run on.I worked on the game client.

They cost money. Students don't like spending unnecessary money. This API allows students / people to avoid fines by writing a short (6 lines, excluding blank lines) script to automatically renew their library books. It's possible to do much more, like send a text / email with details of where to find a list of books in the library (dewey classifications), or how to cite a specific book correctly.It scrapes data from the various library catalogues and presents it in a nice way. It's designed to have a minimal barrier to entry, so anyone can use it, even if they have very little coding experience.Using Python and the requests module. https://regex101.com/ was incredibly useful for testing the numerous regular expressions used, and the Chrome developer tools were helpful for working out how web browsers interacted with the online library catalogue.Perhaps unsurprisingly, the online catalogues aren't built to be friendly to screen scrapers. In some cases, they're really quite horrible.It works! While it's not complete in any sense of the term, it works well with the SirsiDynix Enterprise library catalogue. Support for WebPAC Pro is being implemented, and support for ExLibris Primo is being planned - this should mean that over 83% of BrumHack participants can use the API!We developed our skills in screen scraping, as well as our tenacity for when things don't go so easily. Scott learned Python! We also focused on usability and providing a ""nice"" interface of commands for users (who potentially aren't experienced coders).More implementations - ExLibris Primo is used by a large number of libraries, we hope to support it soon!

It also then doesn't require a twitter account for those who don't have it.It is the most convenient way of providing hackers with snacks and drinks.We used the myo and connected it to an android app and created a server which received the data and posted the results up on a website ready for the volunteers to watch over, with a continuous refresh featureBrumHack 4.0Developed back-end in Node.JS running on Amazon Web Services.Built the android app, and connected it to the Myo armband, and sent the data to the server.Richa Shah

The icecream language is different — allowing users to quickly and easily create working programs directly on their phone.The iOS app allows users to create programs written completely in emojis.The language itself is compiled on the back-end to valid swift code, which is executed and returned to the client.Unicode characters caused a variety of issues, especially working between operating systems and programming languages. We are happy that we were able to resolve most of these issues.We are especially proud of the separation of our code between the client and the server. Everything is general enough to allow us to add more features in the future.We learned a lot about the unicode system and how it is represented in various systems.We would like to expand the language to support further interaction with the user (being able to prompt them for program inputs, implement a simple drawing and animation API). We also would like to create a web front-end to allow users without an iOS device to program in icecream.Happy coding!StacsHack 2016I made the iOS app and did the graphic design.I contributed example icecream code.I worked on the emoji and unicode dictionary initially, then started to develop web app.I made the server side node engine that interprets and compiles the code coming in from the phone via a REST connection to the AWS server.

In Shipyard, we're referring to server repository instances as ""Boats"", and the collection of boats as a ""Harbor"".
When you ship code, the Boat ""sets Sail"" and you do not have to go through the trouble of manually going back to your server, running git pull, then manually restarting your server.In addition, we have written multiple apps and services for various platforms:StacsHack 2016I wrote a fair portion of the backend API, as well as the entirety of the Pebble application.I made the iOS/Android apps, worked on some design with Tim, Pushbullet integration and worked with Scott on the code to keep the boats live and up to date.I wrote the Electron app, and did a bit of design with Jordan.I worked mainly on the backend (largely the models and controllers), and made the boat-add page in the web app. I'd never used Node or Sails before.Scott Maxwell

After a bit of brainstorming, being that most of our teammates are part of some of the sport teams here at St. Andrews, an application for athletes became an obvious. The best piece of hardware to facilitate this was the Myo Armband.Our app currently takes a constant stream of data from the Myo's 8 muscle activity sensors and translates it into data about each muscle group that it is connected to. We consider that even though the current prototype shows only real-time data, the access to that data allows us to add a multitude of features in the future.Our app is built in Android Studio, using Java. We tried to abide to the material design rules as much as we could.One of the main challenges that we had is the Android SDK for Myo doesn't expose the raw data for the 8 muscle activity sensor. Thankfully the open source community came to our rescue, and we found a project that implemented an API that exposed the data we needed. 
The other challenge was in aggregating the individual sensor data so that we match it to the individual statement.We made a working product that might be commercially viableAndroid development and interacting with hardwareWe'll add more features in the future like:StacsHack 2016Worked on the data acquisition for the app. Pulled the data from the Myo and molded it into a easy to use stream.

Morgan.The robot has few sensors which are used to follow the ""track"" which is basically a black line throughout many duck-taped sheets of paper and dealing with various difficulties like dead ends or part of path missing in order to reach the finish.Learning to use the robot and upload code to it was probably the biggest challenges of all because there are not many guides and examples of how to do so and docs sometimes could be a bit more extensive/helpful. Another challenge was getting out of big loops in the traffic as this robot has really small memory capacity, thus cannot remember that he already was in a particular path and that it is actually spinning around. In order to override this problem, we had to include some randomness to the robot which resolved this problem (eventually), but made robot's line-tracking a bit poorer.We are proud that our robot actually manages to go through nearly all difficulties in the track and most of the time does so without loosing the right path and doing something which is not sensible.We enhanced our C skills and, of course, learned to use Arduino Robot.StacsHack 2016Ignas Kancleris

On Oculus this would have been amazing to look around a room and see all your friend's feeds, but due to technical limitations of the hardware (and would-be time constraints) we decided to reduce the scope to use a web cam.Social Face Recogniser consists of two programs. The first lets you add a user, and build up a repository of images of them. You also input their name, and social media usernames.The second program uses sets of images of multiple users to build up an identity profile (the program is trained on the image sets). It then uses the webcam feed to identify who is currently in shot, adds an overlay to identify them as a known user (or an unknown l33t hacker).Using a configuration file, you can specify a set of users that should be able to ""unlock"" the profile. All these users must appear on camera at the same time. This could be used as a developer tool to secure processes. For example, perhaps in a code review scenario, you only want a Pull Request to be accepted if both your managers have looked everything over and agree to unlock the repository.The programs are written in Java 8. We use JavaCV (CV = Computer Vision) as a wrapper around OpenCV. We also use Twitter4J to pull Twitter data, and began implementing GitHub feeds using a 3rd Party API (but ran out of time).JavaCV presented numerous challenges -Having all the basic functionality working! Our demo video shows how well it works (given that it was built in 24 hours).Facial recognition is impressively accurate when training data is large enough (around 30+ images seems good).StacsHack 2016Added several features (Authenticated Box, Colours, Twitter format, and conf file for authenticated box)Isaac Jordan

If you need it again, you have to copy it again, but you have to start looking for it again and wasting time.Pin Board is a storage tool that other than copying a piece of code/text in memory (same function of ctrl+c), it also adds it to a ""Pin Board"" where you are able to see it. Not only see it, but if you click on one of the stored items, you can copy it in memory and quickly retrieve it with the usual paste command (ctrl+v).The copy command of Pin Board is triggered by the combination Ctrl+Alt+C.Pin Board is a plugin of the Atom editor, therefore it was built using CoffeScript and the Cson notation.CoffeeScript is a weird language, but after you get used to it it's cool! The API of Atom is not documented properly enough, and there is not enough material about Atom on the Internet.The storage capacity of PinBoard is limited, because of a problem in making the data retrieval from the Pin Board generic. In fact, it seems quite hard to get to know which item on the Pin Board was pressed, and because of this, there has to be a method for each slot in the Pin Board, making the storage capacity limited.Creating a tool that can make the life of programmers easier! And of course taming CoffeeScript ;-)First of all, that Atom is a stunning text editor, and it's easily customizable! How the plugins in Atom work, their structure and functions.
Let's not forget about the revision of JavaScript but in a different shape, CoffeeScript :)Making it possible to get to know which Pin Board element was pressed, in order to make its capacity unlimited and make only one function to retrieve the data stored in it.Making the pinboard graphical: it will be possible to open it by pressing a button on the editor and see a list of boxes, each containing one of the copied texts.StacsHack 2016Erik Minhas

The aim of the game is to knock your opponents of the platform. You can move left and right using A and D, and you can jump using W. You can fire a spell using by clicking. Spells will fire towards the mouse position. Spells send any opponents that are hit by it flying back. You can charge up a spell by holding down the mouse button. The more charged a spell is the more it will knock your opponents back.

Calculates the positions of individual pupils and compute the distance between them. If this value falls within the range specific to the primary user, return the user's name above the face box, else returns 'Who are you?'Used python libraries in Linux to install OpenCV software. Used available OpenCV modules to detect faces and eyes, implemented code to compute and return relevant variable and text.Choosing which facial proportions gave the most distinctive results, so as to identify different people with a minimum of measurements. Candidates include: distance between each pupil and the bottom of the face box, area between pupils and the chin, distance between each eye and the closest side of the face

We decided to make achievement system, so that it motivates developers to build quality code in a more entertaining way.It adds several types of achievements, such as number of lines, number of commits and quality of code (i.e. number of comments weighed by the total number of lines in a file). Obtaining achievements allows users to gain experience and levels. Developers can also compete with their friends, whose information is fetched from GitHub.We used CoffeeScript, as it is the language of choice for Atom packages development. Some backend is implemented using Python. We divided the tasks, such that some of us were working mostly on frontend, while others focused on backend.None of us used CoffeeScript before, so it was a real challenge to go from JavaScript to developing in a similar, but at the same time very different language. We have never developed packages for Atom before, so we spent a fair amount of time learning that as well. Other difficulties were related to the GitHub API and efficient GitHub repository management.We are proud that we managed to build our first real Atom package and publish it to https://atom.io/packages/.We improved our JavaScript knowledge, got to know GitHub API, learned CoffeeScript and Atom Package development.StacsHack 2016Nikita Samarin

I can attest to the physical and mental pain inflicted to all its users by Michael Bostock: creator of data visualisation library D3.js.However, being able to make visualisations in JavaScript, especially reasonably nice-looking ones with animations and an enormous amount of flexibility regarding how the data is presented, is the reason we endure it.With Gorgeous Graphs Mwah, we simplify the data collection and representation in a variety of common formats, so that users can enjoy Mr. Bostock's work, without giving their life away to StackOverflow.It provides a way to easily send unstructured data to the service, as well as a way to easily retrieve a visualisation of the data in popular formats (e.g. bar charts, line charts, pie charts).As an API that accepts data, placing it into a MongoDB instance. Then we query it and display with a Python NVD3 wrapper, which is an open-source project modified by us.Some of the challenges were especially to do with displaying dates and multiple data sets in one chart. For example, each data point has a date field associated with it, so it makes sense to display a data set as the data contained in each point along with each points' date field. However, doing this results in each data set having different dates, which then results in display inconsistencies.It was necessary to calculate the maximum and minimum dates in the set, and then allow the user to pick a granularity interval. For each interval space, we aggregate the data that belongs in that interval's date range.It works!The front-end is very appealing and user-friendly, and the insertion and retrieval of visualisations works as originally intended. There are some things to iron out though.Wholly unstructured data is not good for aggregation, because it is difficult to aggregate based on more than one field. We learned more about using Flask and MongoDB.Improve the displaying of multiple data sets, add more graph types, and simplify the user onboarding process and graph creation process.StacsHack 2016Jose Salvatierra

This can be a challenging task for someone who is visually impaired or/and has reduced mobility.We remove the requirement to physically touch the control box and allow users to control it with a Myo Wristband. At the same time we provide feedback to the wristband user in the form of vibrations based on the proximity of a traffic light and its current state (green/red).We created an Android app which communicates with the Myo Wristband and with the traffic lights (but there is no need to use the phone - user only needs to launch the app and after syncing with Myo they can put it in their backpack and never use it... user only needs to control the MyoWe didn't have a physical Pedestrian control box - so we had to create a server which listens to the requests and updates/schedules light switching. We used WebSockets to do this dynamically. Then of course we used the Estimote Beacon which would be part of the same physical control box.We would like to make people involved in city councils around the country aware of this project.

The Myo is used in order to control shooting while the VR is used to control player movement.The assets for both games were from two Unity tutorials. We then edited the behaviours slightly to use the Myo device rather than the default controls.

So we came up with an idea to solve this problem with all the desktops and workspaces being projected in 3D on your phone using the fantastic Google Cardboard.It basically runs on your local machine and local network and captures all the active spaces on your computer and transmits them to our Android application where you use it with the help of Google Cardboard to project every workspace in virtual reality. These spaces keep on refreshing so that you can get a real time view of your desktop.For the front end of the application we have used Unity along with Google Cardboard SDK for Unity 3D. For this Unity project we have used certain GameObjects which run on C# scripts to query the back end and get the latest update of the desktop screens and workspace. Whereas on the back end we run a node.js server which streams the images which are captured from X11 using FFMpeg.The basic idea was to use Android Studio but then we switched to Unity after a great talk by David. But none of our team members had experience in Unity so we had to learn everything from the basics, learn C# etc. Another challenge was to refresh the stream constantly so that we don't miss out on anything going on. On the back end it was tough streaming the images correctly and efficiently.First accomplishment would be not sleeping for almost 24 hours. Second would be to pick up a new programming language in a day and make something useful with it. Learning new software and SDK from scratch.We learned C#, Unity and core features of Linux to capture the image. Maybe some experience in Karaoke singing as well. Also we worked with graphics a little bit so it was good. Above all we learned how to use Google Cardboard.Using live video feeds instead of image feeds. Better rendering in 3D and mayb full HD resolution.IC Hack '16I worked on the front end of the application. Wrote some code in C# and didn't sleep much. Ate a lot.

As this is a Hackathon, we decided it would be best to adopt the theme of the event instead of working on something unrelated.Our project is a web application at it's core but comes with a twist. It cannot be navigated using a mouse and keyboard. All the user interaction is done via gesture tracking and state control. The gesture tracking is powered by Leap Motions Controller which uses a set of cameras to achieve accurate finger, hand and arm tracking.The first thing we did was to split the project into its smaller components; namely the gesture recognition part and the web user interface part. 2 of us worked on the first while the remaining 3 on the later.Gesture Recognition
Leap Motion has created a variety of libraries that can be used to interact with the Controller. We used the one written in Javascript in order to make the interfacing with the website as effortless as possible. While working on this project we discovered that even though the controller has a wide range of ""preset"" gestures, we needed to add some new ones such as the whole hand roll (X - Y axis). We also discovered that while the technology is certainly impressive, it comes with some limitations. For example, some gestures appear to be more accurate than others and there were occasions where the Controller was picking up a lot of unrelated noise. The noise can be cancelled by keep track of how long each object has been in view for, but unfortunately we did not have enough time to implement this.User Interface
For the user interface we wanted to use as much available code as possible. The charts were generated using the Google Chart libraries and the financial data were taken from fixer.io. For styling, we used the Materialize CSS framework in order to make the website look decent with the least amount of effort possible.The biggest challenge we had was getting all the data necessary asynchronously while also keeping the performance at acceptable levels. Also, we found that it was difficult to get the sensor to work once we deployed our website to Azure.The Leap Motion controller is an impressive device and can have a wide range of applicationsIC Hack '16Worked on the hand gesture recognition and part of the graph visualization algorithmsCreated the second graph on website.

I think the first code that went in was the code that interacts with DBus to gather some interesting data about the number of packages installed on your system.It's actually quite hard to do everything alone :o) but I knew that going in, anyway.The backend supports shuttling logs upwards, and the architecture is designed such that you can chain nodes together.The provisioning system is super neat as well - you end up with (eventually, once the server support is there) a binary containing a one-time use, embedded certificate which can be used for generating proper key material on the target server.Red Bull sugar free tastes like death.IC Hack '16Luke Granger-Brown

My mind connected with the jobs data, understanding how engineers are sent out for maintenance but might abort the job due to lack of information about was needed. That engineer might not bother to accurately record why they aborted the job, or even if finished they might not record what they did.I could have reviewed the data, running queries to flag up places issues commonly happen and I could have written a report on how good it was. That's my day job, and as this is a hackathon I wanted to see how my coding would follow my wandering mind. I also wanted to think how engineers and team leaders could be engaged with gaps in data and a potential domino effect. Simply pointing out which engineers/jobs had bad data, wasn't enough.My hacked-together project takes all the jobs associated to an asset. It then paints different aspects of the jobs onto a ""flag"" image. The human mind can easily spot patterns, and most importantly breaks in patterns. [see annotated flag] An asset may get jobs every few months and that be normal, but at one point there is is a job that was only a few days after the following job. That can draw us in, and perhaps every time the pattern breaks it is after an orange dot which means no comment was given.The real benefit is the view of assets. The idea is that NWL staff will be able to filter the list of assets (or generating reports) in the way they are used to, I have just hard-coded some examples. For example, show all assets with more than had more than 40 jobs, or show pump assets. On this page, the ""flag"" images of each asset are shown. Because the filter has selected assets of an specific nature, the flags are likely to be the same. For example the time-since-last-job bar may be all greens because the assets are reliable ones maintained every 5 years. It is not the individual assets to look at, but the typical pattern of these flags and then you can see where there are breaks.The data was converted from Excel into CSV and into a mySQL database, thanks to critical help from Simon and his patience waiting for conversions to run. When the detail page of an asset is looked at, PHP runs some queries on the tables to get various data of the jobs. The GD image library is used to draw different shapes onto a grey rectangle. There is nothing amazing to this build, but I hadn't spent a lot of time with the GD functions before as previous work had started with images rather than create them from scratch. My main work was reviewing the data, and learning what the field names were.Converting the data had it's problems. Large Excel files are horrible, CSV is better.
I was aware of limited time, and thus limited opportunity I had. I didn't push myself to build a big user interface, and that actually resulted in me skipping on another project idea I started forming.Visualising about 50 rows on a 300 x 100 pixel image, displaying those on a page/gird, and thus being able to visualise multiple tables/queries of a relational database on such a flat view. Normally such a view would require flicking between tabs/sheets and keeping in mind what each one looked like and how they linked.
Playing with the GD image library was a fun accomplishment, but it's only the start.GD library has some bugs in it that limited what I could draw, I may be able to get around those. I've been able to learn about specific assets that stood out as a result of the flag images, although I'm not a domain-expert to know exactly what  that means or confirm it is something that isn't right.Understanding the values is important, and although advice is on hand it would need a lot of sit-down time to see what is relevant. The break points for shapes changing colour, and what information to display could be tweaked and  adjusted. One of the things to add next would be a marker as to the priority-level of jobs. The image could also display information about the asset that isn't job-specific.Improve water utility efficiencyGregory Marler

We wanted a way to be able to identify who was left in the defence against the war against Christmas.  This is why we created Festive O Meter.Based on any Twitter handle, it analyses their tweets, and brings back a percentage of their Christmas spirit.  A map displaying festive hotspots is also showed on the webpage.Using the Twitter API and our own sentiment analysis engine we found a way to judge someone on how festive they are.  Then, we built an angular based frontend which interfaces with our REST API endpoints and Google Maps API.We emulated the Hack The Holidays design scheme and incorporated this graphical design amongst our final products.  With this rengineering of scalable and globalised Twitter data we put context into an otherwise abstract dataset using Web 2.0, without boiling the ocean.By being both time, and space efficient, we allowed for maximum productivity with frequent localised on site scrum meetings with the product owner collective.Had to submit to devpost 3 hours before deadline.

The main problem was that when we try to transfer a photo from our mobile phone to our mac, it's so frustrating. That's because AirDrop 1 out of 5 times works great and the other 4 does not detect the other device (the one you want to send the files).
So then we built our own, one that within an app you choose your photos from your mobile phone and then the device itself detects the computers you have at the same network and then you choose where you want to send it and it saves directly into the folder you have set.Hack the HolidaysDaniel Gil

Later, we realised this app can be used by more than just school children, so we removed the school theme by not using words such as ""subject"" for the tags.Todio is a todo list which stores your tasks and adds tags to them, and then displays the tags. It allows for adding descriptions to the tasks too.We used css for the style of the webpage, then we used javascript for the client-side scripting along with the jquery plugin for increased functionality. We used AJAX to talk to the server whilst remaining on the same webpage allowing for data to be loaded on demand and the page to be more dynamic. Html was used to create the website itself.Our first challenge was the login, as we attempted to use Google's login API. Though this was guaranteed as secure, it did not work and we later realised we would have to code the login in php. To prevent a compromise on security, this took a rather long amount of time, and we faced many bugs too, so before we knew it, it was past midnight and all we really had was a login. Time management is a target for the future.
Another challenge was that one team member did not have a pc to work from, so our productivity was minimised (by 33%), which will change next time for sure.We managed to create a prototype of our core idea and created a basic UI. Though none of had special expertise in any particular language, or any experience with hackathons, we worked under the pressure and produced a product, though substandard.Alongside actual programming knowledge, such as MySQL, we have learnt many skills that will help us to improve our programming experience and maybe even to perform better at a future hackathon. This includes planning the amount of time we dedicate to each task, by producing a Gantt chart for example. We will also plan the UI in more detail, as the choosing of colours took an unnecessary amount of time, as did choosing the layout.We have many ideas for improving our current product as it did not reach the level of completion we initially hoped for. The most important next step is including a calendar function, as this was the basis for a lot of the app. Then, we plan to improve the UI, making it more accessible not only to the average user but to those who are less able, for example a setting for the visually impaired or colour changes for the colour blind. A further stretch would be allowing for a link to other file services, such a dropbox, allowing people to work on their tasks wherever in the world they are. 
Last but definitely not least, a working Google login will be an aim for the future, as well as working logins from other popular OpenID Providers.Hack the HolidaysThough my coding skills were not apt, and the fact that I did not have a PC did not help the product itself, my role was managing the team as a whole. I ensured that the coders were motivated and positively coding, even when the app felt like it was failing. 
I also visualised the initially idea, and created draft designs, which were the basis for the app. 
Lastly, I became a spokesperson for the team, and also dealt with all of the form-filling and part of the hackathon not directly linked to coding.
Of course, I did code parts of the app, primarily the UI, and if I wasn't directly coding it, I did provide direction to whoever was.I was the main person when linking the databases to the front end. In addition I helped to create the tables used within the website and worked on the technical aspects of the front end site.CaughtEx

So we pulled random and weird ideas out of our heads until we came up with: Hackindr - Tinder for Hackathon Ideas! However, this idea was quickly sidelined by the arrival of the MLH hardware lab and the realisation that I had bought my Passport. The next few hours were spent renting out a selection of hardware, from Oculus Rifts to Leap Motions, and we quickly came up with the idea of a virtual keyboard that allowed you to type in midair using the Leap Motion. But we had little success with tracking individual fingers with enough accuracy so we attempted to use the Thalmic Myo to create a morse code keyboard but we also ran into problems. So, driven by our aim to actually finish a hack within 24 hours we returned to Hackindr.Hackindr is a mobile and web app that allows users to like or dislike random hackathon ideas, see the top ten ideas and submit their own.Firstly, we built a REST API using Python, Flask and Postgres which was deployed on Heroku. We then connected this to our native Android app written into Java. We then built a web interface, originally using Angular, but ended up being built in Node.js and Express.js and hosted on Heroku. Finally, we also began to work on an iOS version using Swift.After encountering problems with Thalmic Myo and Leap Motion we were hoping for Hackindr to relatively problem free, however, this was not the case. Our first major problem was when the backend suddenly stopped accepting valid usernames and passwords which was solved by turning it off and on again. Our next problem was trying to figure out how to make HTTP requests in Swift which was eventually solved. Additionally, we encountered a nearly infinite series of NullPointerExceptions in Android app which were mostly caused by ourselves accidently deleting lines in our sleep deprived haze.Overall, we are really impressed by the fact we actually finished our hack with the web and android versions working before 9am.Hack the HolidaysI built the REST API using Python and Flask which I deployed on Heroku. I also worked alongside Emily on the Android implementing Sign Up pages and improving the UI. I also developed the iOS version using Swift which was my first time using Swift to interact with a REST API.Charles Thomas

At the moment this process runs smooth as long as you have a modest amount of nodes between the links. This could be improved by building the dataset using C++ and buying a better computer.We managed to make a significant and trust full visualisation of how one piece of information surfs over the internet and influences our lives even if we do not realise this. We can also use these data to find out about other webpages that referenced the main URLs.I have learned a lot about crawling and about how big the internet is. The main lesson was why algorithms have to be efficient. THE INTERNET IS HUGE!!!We might have to improve the efficiency of our shortest path tree algorithm and rewrite some of our function. Create a powerful front-end.AstonHackI worked on the second part in which we show the shortest path between 2 links.

Everyone is given a specific topic (eg. Video Games) and the audience must all submit one or more websites which they think are related to the given topic. After the round ends (after 30 seconds), the contestant must then choose a website themselves, and the aim is to pick the website which was chosen least by the audience (such as by picking a very obscure website) while still being related to the topic.M'pointless uses the Majestic API to judge whether a given website is related to the topic,I started off not sure what to build, so I wrote an events system which allows the JS frontend to talk to the Bottle back-end through Ajax calls. After I wrote this, I needed to decide what to actually make that was multiplayer and web-based, so I brainstormed various game ideas until I came to TV shows, and realised that Pointless works well as it has a large audience.The JSON payload of each Ajax call is quite a lot if it's being sent to >100 people at once so I needed to find a way to condense all of the information in each event into as little space as possible.As I didn't spend a lot of time structuring the project at the start, all of the client-side logic is one ugly JavaScript file, so maintaining it toward the end of the project wasn't easy!Finally the Majestic API was very information-dense and returned a lot of numbers so I wrote my own Python wrapper around Majestic's Python wrapper around their own web API, to allow the server code to at least be a little bit maintainableLiterally the only frameworks I've used are Bottle on the backend and jQuery/Bootstrap on the front-end  - everything else is done from scratch!Basically had to learn Ajax from scratch as I've never used it before, and also got to know some of the more detailed intricacies of routing in the Bottle frameworkMake the website look nicer! :DTry it out at http://tomgalvin.uk/AstonHackThomas Galvin

If you are connecting using a smartphone, It will redirect you to a ""controller"" page which has a virtual joystick and a ""Kick"" button.

The controller and game scene were built in JavaScript whereas the website layout is in css.We had problems coming to terms with how to integrate Pusher into our system as it was a completely new API for us to learn. We had all also lost a bit of proficiency when it came to JavaScript, so we had to brush up on our skills!As a whole team, we were able to overcome the daunting Pusher API and made a very impressive game (at least in my opinion ;) ). Also, I and my team had amazing teamwork as we worked to each other's strengths and helped each other out when we could.I had learned how to use the Pusher API to create a JavaScript game.Who know's what the future holds? ;)AstonHackSet up the server, designed the website.I developed the backend part of the game regarding web.

Then the player will have to send their plumbers to fix the problem. There are mainly 3 types of plumbers: normal, quick, efficient. The bigger leakages are be fixed only if you have certain tools. A really important thing to mention is that the player will also be given the opportunity to win big prizes and bonuses in game, whenever they report a real leakages.For my first time, I was mostly focusing on the front-end. Helped develop the login, options, register, loading forms. My main focus was the user friendly interface to engage people into playing more and more. I enjoyed writing C# in Unity in a really fun way.I ran into challanges mostly in the begining, when I had to watch loads of tutorials about using the Unity's API and that of C# as well. It was hard for me to build the location based map, but finally managed to take the Google Maps api working on our app.I am proud of the work me and my team have put into this project. I really enjoyed the idea and mostly enjoyed its implementation.I have learned new languages and more about the Unity game engine. I am also planning to create my own mini projects in the future as well.If the app is approved I would like to have it go to the next level. For example, multiple minigames between players. real time reports, interesting communication system, more and more upgrades and tools.AstonHackI developed 95% of server-side in PHP.I developed the main application back-end, together with the login system, in C#.

Vadim had prior experience working with beacons technology, Nick is already a hackathon war-hero and veteran, Marius is the laser-focused web-dev guy and myself, well, I'm soaking all that we're doing. Be it through business modelling, joining dev talks, searching for resources or APIs or writing our story. 
As it unravels.waveRoll is a solution to one big pain point from UK's rails industry: counting in real-time the people from each carriage during a journey. Based on this, it can provide business insights for the train operators and it can also tell passengers where there is a high probability that they can get a seat. Before they board.We actually started having in mind the two elements, the silverrail API capabilities and the iBeacons techology. After quickly sketching up the requirements for a webAPI, talking about microservices, scalability, we thought more in depth about how we might get this in front of company executives and travellers alike.Getting into the core of waveRoll, there are a few considerations to be made. First, the analytics system is built around the Apache Kafka high-throughput messaging system, which is designed to efficiently aggregate massive amounts of data; its distributed nature allows capacity to be added simply by allocating nodes. 
For data at rest, we are using ElasticSearch as our storage engine, which is similarly distributed and resilient. In a massive real-world deployment, we would likely abandon this prototype in favour of a higher performance database such as PostGreSQLWho doesn't love random technical incongruences on a Saturday evening during a 60h+ hackathon?
The actual JSON that we were receiving from the silverrail API, our beloved sponsor, was in the wrong format. The coordinates were almost unusable, save for a brilliant algorithm furiously typed by Nick, chief-in-hackathon.Now, I'm not saying that this was our best accomplishment. The actual greatness was for all 120 of us to be here, building and iterating over ideas. Beginners and artisans alike, contributing towards a palpable progress within an entire industry. In less than 3 days.As of now, we're still inching away in developing our beloved creation, making waveRoll robust and focused on solving a single paint point. 
It's tomorrow when we'll demo it and all the cards will fall into place. For me, it already is a crazy learning experience which I will never forget. My only hope is that someday, I will be able to pass over what I've learned now to someone who, like me today, was given a chance to see product development at its best.HackTrain 2.0Nicholas Lee

Arriving at his station, Steve joins a queue of 8 people also waiting for a ride home, in the cold and wet British weather.What Steve doesn't know is that Sally was on the same train visiting her Aunt  who lives just 3/4 mile from Steve and she too is in the queue waiting for a taxi.Wouldn't it be great if there was some way that Steve and Sally could identify their common destination and share a single taxi there.Traxi brings people together to share taxi rides to their final destination, reducing costs to passengers and giving them a more integrated stress free travel experienceJust by visiting the Traxi webapp Steve and Sally can enter a few basic details and they will then get notified of passengers who could potentially share a ride. All that is left to do is meet up and share that ride to their final destinationThe technology behind traxi is a spatial aware Geofire database, cloud hosted for scalabiliy both up and out. Utilising APIs from google and Uber, Traxi uses its search algorithm to match people to their taxi needs.

They practically have the same conditions. Well, it's because they are in good company with friends and other people who celebrate the same thing. Why cant we have this kind of environment for trains? We want to start pioneering that shift of mindset through our app ChatPoint.ChatPoint is an application that encourages customers to socialize with others on a train by providing them a platform to chat with other people they could possibly get along with.Using JavaScript at the client side to display data and node.js on the server side to manage distribution of messages.Most customers described their train rides as ""long"", ""dull"", and ""boring"".And contrary to popular belief, they do talk to other people on the train. But only if the coversation was started by the other person.We found it interesting that only 2 out of the 12 people we physically approached declined a chat with us for the survey.Most of them are open to chatting especially when they are interested on the topic.Chat point would be a great tool for them to pass their time on the train.Since we have a huge collection of customer data, train companies can now adjust certain strategies accordingly. For example some months could be lean seasons and some unknown tourist destinations could only have a few passengers.Through the app's backend analytics, you could see patterns of certain type of people who use the trains that you couldn't have guessed normally. So you could adjust the marketing accordingly.You could also see patterns of people's behaviour and their sentiments so you could also adjust operations accordingly.We would have certain chat topics that are sponsored by brands and people would get certain perks if they participate in the discussion such as a discount on the ticket or in shops. So it's kind of an ad but not really because based on their likes, people would want to participate in the discussion.Based on our survey, the 70% of yes' was raised to 93% when the concept of discounts was introduced.HackTrain 2.0I worked mainly on the backend, getting the chat clients communicating with one another through the server.Cameron Wright

Using voice analysis we are able to provide travelers with exactly what they want and in a matter of seconds, rather than wasting their time with clunky interfaces that create stress and long queues.Train of Thought is built by integrating advanced speech recognition API's, IBM's Watson Artificial Intelligence services including the Natural Language classifier and the SilverRail API to pull up to date information about train routes and schedules in the United Kingdom. As a voiced based application, we focussed on an ultra-high accuracy of speech-to-text transcription using Google's new web speech API. The accuracy is above 90% for most accents and use cases, and we achieved 100% accuracy for most tests and common queries. IBM's Natural Language classifier service, a part of the Bluemix basket of Watson service, then run the transcribed speech through a classifier that we trained to recognize common customer queries at kiosks such as route finding, ticket purchasing and ticket printing based on a pre-booked purchase and reference number. The confidence index for most results returns by the classifier is over 98% due to the extraordinarily well trained, machine learning service that we built and integrated.  Once queries are classified, the Dialog AI service from Watson is used to provide a fast and accessible interaction with the customer to buy tickets, see route information or print pre-booked tickets. For ticket purchasing and routing, the SilverRail API is called to get the up to date routes between two locations which are extracted from the transcribed text.A seamless, fast and accessible user experience. Buy a ticket in less than 10 seconds.HackTrain 2.0Designed the UI/ UX for interaction with the voice controlled system + rendering of proposed kiosk design.I worked on the back - end of the system implementing the functionality to be able to route  the cheapest/fastest trains from a station to another as well as book the ticket.

Train service disruptions occur for many reasons, including train malfunction, accidents, congestion and human error. When disruptions occur, the resulting delays propagate to other trains operating on the same line. This problem is one of the biggest in the rail industry today. A common solution is to re-route trains and reshuffle staff rotas to minimise the effect of a disruption. This is currently done manually, on an ad-hoc basis by dedicated teams. RICCS uses a mathematical constraints model that takes into account routes, trains and staff in order to optimise the schedule given a service disruption scenario as input.HackTrain 2.0Built the web application and required plumbing components - parsing model output into a timeline of train and staff positions.

With so many different formats and naming conventions combined with the scale of the data, it was incredibly difficult to make this useful. All credit to Tom for making this happen!!!We want to expand on the prototype we built using the London to Birmingham line and plan to take it further to other major rail routes in the country. Ultimately the idea is that we will be able to use historic data to create a predictive analysis of where disruption will occur so that proactive action can be taken.HackTrain 2.0Collected survey responses and analysed them to find out demand and established requirements for our app.Made the web app interface overlaid onto Google maps which reads in data from JSON files to plot locations of stations and colour code sections of track based on delay health.Processing historical dumps of the National Rail Darwin feed to replay and populate a database with train positions and track delay health.REST endpoint to consume the database.jlb-qi

With so many different formats and naming conventions combined with the scale of the data, it was incredibly difficult to make this useful. All credit to Tom for making this happen!!!We want to expand on the prototype we built using the London to Birmingham line and plan to take it further to other major rail routes in the country. Ultimately the idea is that we will be able to use historic data to create a predictive analysis of where disruption will occur so that proactive action can be taken.HackTrain 2.0Collected survey responses and analysed them to find out demand and established requirements for our app.Made the web app interface overlaid onto Google maps which reads in data from JSON files to plot locations of stations and colour code sections of track based on delay health.Processing historical dumps of the National Rail Darwin feed to replay and populate a database with train positions and track delay health.REST endpoint to consume the database.jlb-qi

Not everyone has a friend in the country that they want to go visit - Further becomes that trusted friend in your pocket.Locals share their experiences, so that Travellers can experience places like a local. Travellers pay a small fee to access the full itinerary of items and the locals get paid for sharing their knowledge.Where a startup like Hype is about advice from locals for locals, and another startup called Esplorio is about advice by tourists for tourists - Further solves the problem through local knowledge for tourists.A local goes online to write an experience, they log in and see their dashboard.
They want to create a new experience, so they add a title, categories, summary & a heads up of a budget if the experience is likely to cost the traveller something.The local then adds  the items - the step by step bits of the day. These nuggets include how to get there, where to eat, what to take with and when to go. Locals include the tips they feel are important to the experience.When the local is done, the experience goes live. The local then sees a dashboard to view the experiences they have uploaded. Since the experiences are sold for a small fee, the locals can see & manage their revenue. The locals get 80% of the amount paid by the travellers and we get 20%. It is a marketplace business model with the potential to become subscription based too.Andreas’s Nordic twin Brother Andrs (who likes cats) wants to go to Cyprus.He logs into the app, where he’ll find the experiences he's bought. For this trip he wants a new experience so he heads over to Search & Discover.He selects Cyprus & chooses a few categories, like romantic, beach, sunshine, coastal. Out of the suggestions, he chooses the experience he wants and looks at the summary. He decides to purchase and gets access to the full experience.During the experience, he can check his watch for full access to the details of the experience as the final step in a truly multiplatform travel experience.Destination Hack: LondonProduct Design - information architecture, wireframing, UX, brand development, interface design & a sprinkle of magic.Helped refine the business model, contributed to the overall brand development and colour scheme, and helped out with the design.

By paying higher prices, travelers can buy flexibility and avoid change fees/surcharges, where lower prices represent a trade-off, with more restrictions.The Airlines take advantage of that and collect over $2 Billion every year just from the US travellers just on cancellation fees.
Millions of travellers are disappointend and hurt by harsh cancellation fees, booking restrictions and charges.Today's technological advancement can allow the airlines become FAIRER to their clients and approach their problems and needs!Examples where companies stimulate bookings and consumer stimulation are:If the airlines do not keep their lion's share of travellers in fear of high fees for cancellations and unaffordable prices for flights it will give them an opportunity for continuous market growth and higher revenues with ever more happy clients.
Some of the advanced insurance companies start to pay back money to their clients, if the latter do not have accidents in a longer period of time. This transforms their clients into permanent and happy clients.Our goal is to generate a product of RADICAL CHANGE (not incremental one).
Therefore we suggest to the Airline companies a possible cooperation with AIRMAX, that will generate great yields for both businesses and consumers on a new level.The AIRMAX app rips the data from all forwarded emails with flight and accommodation confirmations to TripCase.
Once the user opens the APP he can see all his recent open bookings.
He can choose one and post it in form of a blogpost on the AIRMAX wall of offers.The user can choose what he prefers: a swap, a sale or both options.AIRMAX charges through PAYPAL the clients that BUY the offered booking.
If the Flight or Accommodation booking is swapped - AIRMAX simply transfers the client data to the original service provider and directs the buyer through PAYPAL to send the money to the person who provided the ticket.In case a user wants to make a gift for someone he can share his offer in Facebook/Twitter and if anyone likes it and the time/dates convene the person - then the gift is ready!AIRMAX is a bridge (trusted middleman) between the airline companies and the consumers.
The consumers pay a small fee each time they swap, sell or transfer the ticket.
The partnering airlines get a monthly lump sum payment or per each transfer (as the airline operator chooses).
If more and more Airlines will start implementing the AIRMAX system that will allow people swap, sell or gift their booking to another person (without speculation), this will stimulate and boost the consumer activity and in result bring more profit.Contacting the Airlines Companies and the Service Facilitators to accept a new system and way of selling the tickets/making the bookings.
The future of Travel is maximum flexibility and less restrictions for the clients. 
Get a taste of Future with AIRMAX and help us build a more perfect travel world - fairer and less restrictive and more popular for the consumers and more profitable for the airlines!Destination Hack: LondonI worked on Nodejs api and on Android app (integrated with sebre, tripcase ...)Worked on Android appIan Bau

Almost every site requires either a destination or a date before you can even choose the priceThe first page you get to on the site is just a search form with 1 price field. You set you budget and then the you will get Flights and hotels. From these results you can filter by the weather and if there is car rentals available in the destination.Flights: The first step is to use Sabre's DestinationFinder. We start from and London airport and get the maximum of 50 results back, with the lowest fare for that day. Once the flights have been added to firebase the results page starts updating.Hotels: As soon as the flight API is complete we use Mr & Mrs Smith's availability API to retrieve all the available hotels that are near the airports where flights are available. Once we have a shortlist of relevant hotels we get the best bookable rates for the required dates. As these results come in the search results page is updates and hotels are added in the results with the flights.Car Hire: The next step is to do the car search, as this is not always required this is just an option to show results where car hire is available at the destination airport.Weather: We also added a weather API (http://openweathermap.org/api) so that we could show the forecast for your trip on the results page.Because of the amount of data required to retrieve for each search we have limited it to the next weekends results (the trip will always be Friday-Sunday). This meant we could limit the amount of data we had to retrieve for the purpose of the demonstration.We began searching for flights based on the maximum price entered, but this sometimes used the maximum budget available (e.g. £500 was the maximum price some of the flight results that came back were £500 meaning there was no budget for a hotel). To overcome this, and based on the fact we limited the results to the weekend, we decided to limit the max fare for the flights to 80% of the budget, meaning we were more likely to have enough in the budget to have a hotel too.The gradual display of results, using firebase we save the search and then as we get results we populate the results page.
The ease of use of the search.More filters for the search.
Don't limit the search to the next weekend, we can expand the search to be within the next 3 months, then the next year as we grow.
Add all transport options - in the budget include the train fares and/or taxis to and from the airport (or have them as a filter)

We made a savings plan but I thought we could do more than just squirreling away money into a bank account. Other influences are London FinTech companies like TransferWise, who gave me the confidence to even consider providing consumer facing monetary-like products.A customer (or saver) sets up a recurring transfer using our app and then slowly builds up their travel fund. They also specify what kind of holiday they are saving for, which helps reinforce saving habits by visualising their goal.At the same time, we allow supply side partners to make private sale offers to our savers, based on their account balance as well as holiday preferences. Since our savers are fully qualified, after all they have money in the bank for a trip, they are high value leads. Also, since deals are fenced in for savers, suppliers can charge less than on the internet.Interestingly, it was easier to setup a recurring money transfer than to find hotels for our savers. I finally settled on using Sabre's new Hotel API but unfortunately it is limited to 50 destinations and doesn't have any images. I felt there would be an opportunity to integrate with Google HPA, but they don't offer their hotel ads outside Google properties (as far as I could tell).I probably should have used some of our (Hotels.com) internal APIs.Developed the internal APIs first, which worked well and will replace the Mobile First trend in a few years.  Glad to recruit an iOS developer, I wasn't expecting that. Really enjoyed writing lots of JavaScript for 24 hours.There were a few features of CouchDB that I realised I was using wrong. Also that Stripe is a really good platform for payments, I would definately use them again.As far as I can tell, no one has done this before and I think Paid Vacation is aligned with a number of trends. I could really succeed with some funding. There are challenges on the marketing and regulatory side, but other startups are working through similar issues.Destination Hack: LondonMaciej Matyjas

1007,Destination Hack: London,1007,,1007,"Connecting flyers with baggage space to charities in need“Travita” - an online solution to link flyers with spare baggage capacity with charities that need items that are cheaper overseas, using the Twilio and TripCase APIs.As a frequent flyer I often buy laptops, clothes and other goods overseas in duty free or in other shops overseas to take advantage of lower prices. Then a few years ago I was sent to South Africa, a lecturer at a local University asked me if I could get copies of an economics textbook they needed because textbooks are very expensive there. He also mentioned that electronic items like computers were also extremely expensive. So, I had a brainwave! Why not connect flyers who want to donate to charities that need items from overseas? Many travellers are reluctant to donate money to charities, because they maybe unsure about where the money goes, and may want to shy away from voluntourism. And so Travita was born!Travellers use their Trip Case credentials to log into the Travita website or app. Based on the final travel destination of their journey, they are directed to Charities and items that the Charities want. The Traveller then selects an item they would like to purchase for the Charity. A text message alert is sent to the Charity via Twilio informing them of the purchase.The user then picks up the item at an airport shop or may opt to buy the item second hand.In the future an app version of the website will be available. The traveller will be able to drop off the item in a smart box at the destination airport and the charity will be informed of the drop off and in flight journey using text messages from Twilio.We plan to also contact airlines to get them onboard. Monetisation will be through sponsorship from airlines as part of their strategy for  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), who will also pay for the awarding of Air Mile points to travellers as a thank you for their charity work.Other monetisation could come from advertising pop ups on the app or website. During/after a journey passengers could fill in a customer survey regarding the flight or trip and this information could be sold to the various stakeholders in the journey e.g. airlines, hotel chains and so on. And after completing the drop, the traveller has the option to share news of their charity donation (and Gift Aid) to Facebook or Twitter, which includes an advert from some of the sponsors.Destination Hack: LondonI was the idea person and worked on the pitch and the overall direction of the project.I am the co-founder of a travel start up called Travique.I worked on front- end design, development and user journey of stakeholders.I was responsible for back-end development of the prototype.

But, 95% of the suggested holiday activities in current travel apps are aggregated from big companies who retain most of the profit. Local activity providers rely on word of mouth or the cooperation with travel agencies to secure business. The travel agencies also take big margins for connecting the tourists with these activity providers.Some small providers try to offer their activities directly, but being honest, I've never feel completely safe. However, by connecting with providers and getting to know them as locals, I've met awesome people around the world. With the help of their feedback I came up with the idea of Sharrio. Shariio is a mobile app focusing on connecting people who would like to participate in fun activities locally.We give our providers the ability to post their activities, chat to interested participants within the app and connect directly with each other. Based on the review system and the ID verification feature, tourists feel safe connecting with the local providers directly, and can get an authentic experience at a lower cost. The local providers also take a much higher cut of the revenue and this makes their business more sustainable.The user connects with Facebook. Based on their location he will see all activities offered near-by including important details. Swiping right saves the activity to a favourites list and swiping left skips to the next activity offering. Reviewing the favourites list allows the user to chat directly with the activity provider to determine any unknown details, and can then request a booking.Integration of the following two payment solutions, allowing app monetisation and providers to accept payment directly in the app:Destination Hack: LondonSherin Nuernberg

The goal of the application is to help you find where you can fly and spend your trip depending on the weather forecast. Imagine you just want to get away, rest on a sunny beach and you don’t want to spend millions on that. You don’t want to check every beach destination you now and individually check the weather forecast, flight prices and hotel prices. SunFollower app pro- vides inspirations for possible destinations from your origin airport togeth- er with extended flight itineraries info, weather forecast and hotels listing. Destinations are presented on a Google Map represented by current weather conditions icons. To see the details of the destination just click on it and see detailed weather forecast (temperature, weather conditions, wind speed and directions) for the following 5 days. SunFollower provides you with graph to visualise the prices for the flights for the next 5 days. You can pick a day from the graph and look for flights to see detailed itineraries and prices and actually pick a flight.
Ok, so you’ve selected your flight, but since you’re departing in just a few days it would be nice if the app could help you with finding a hotel for your stay. And that’s what SunFollower actually does – it gets you a detailed hotel search to help you pick a perfect stay ;)We had to connect to multiple  API's in order to find appropriate information such as airports. Sunflower connects to Sabre API's, GetYourGuide API, Yahoo Weather API through to SimpleWeatherJS library and our own bridge (middleware) which allows us to connect to Sabre API.We delivered fully fledged application during 24 hours! Keeping the deadline it was the most challenging part of that project because there were lots of work ahead of us! The dev team was so tiny, only two persons were working on the app and finally accomplished the goal, so we are very proud of that.We have learned how to use multiples APIs in order to deliver application which can support travellers. We have struggled a little bit with some technologies issues but finally all of them have been solved.There are two possibilities which are implemented in the app where you can book a ticket and monetise the incoming traffic. These options at the moment has been mocked up - but the plan is to replace the mockups with real booking process. We are also going to implement more intelligent search so that the results would be closer to the users requirements.Destination Hack: LondonJakub Hajek

1029,Destination Hack: London,1029,,1029,"Reinventing hotel bookingsWhen seeking to obtain the best value for money in hotel booking, current booking websites are limited. As a traveller, we are usually forced to book a single hotel in a location despite staying more than one night there. As a result, travel can be costlier and less enjoyable for travellers. Our solution reinvents the booking process by enabling tourists look for the best value/quality combination of multiple hotel properties in the same city.It works in a traditional booking way except you as a traveller are presented not only with single hotel choices.We chose a platform which was not our strongest one so we had to move to another platform after several hours into the project. 
We were hoping to integrate more APIs, but time constraints didn't allow us to integrate more than two API - one from Sabre Travel called Hotel REST API Hotel Shopping Endpoint and GIATA -  GIATA Hotel Guide Multilingual
On the GIATA API we managed to use the description and the pictures, but only in English, not multi-language capabilities yetOur development talent managed to build a prototype which makes use of two APIs - one from Sabre and one from GIATA - GIATA Hotel Guide Multilingual
We produced a nice user interface with good graphics and clear logic for the travellerDeveloped our knowledge of APIs

I then worked with a number of interested parties to form a group with complementary skills to start to hack the idea into an MVP.I was a key part of the team who developed the website idea into actual requirements and deliverables and defined the MVP.Further work was primarily on creating the pitch deck and other materials relating to the non tech side of the project.Vlad S

Purely because we didn't have enough time and wanted to focus on the combination of the SeatGuru API and SeatMap API for a specific journeyBieng able to combine both the SeatGuru API and SeatMap API and putting the fundamentals in place to use the InstaFlightSearchOne needs to focus on specific airlines, a lot of the airlines we did calls on the SeatMap API didn't return a response so we didn't get the seat information to help us find the best seat for the person requesting the journey.We are going to look at seeing if we can re-visit the InstaFlightSearch, focussing on only airlines we know return a response from the SeatMap API together with focussing on airlines who offer specific seats for purchase (like emergency exit seats)Destination Hack: LondonThe entire developmentIvan Fraixedes

So we took Monopoly as our inspiration. 
Also, we decided to use some of the most popular games of N64 as our properties because everybody loves old school video games!-Objective: To be the most wealthy player in the game by buying, selling and renting their properties. 
-Participants: 2 to 6 players. 
-Money: Each player will receive a total amount of £1500
-The bet: To be able to play the game, every player is going to be asked to set a bet of minimum £5 using a Pay Pal account. The player that wins the game, will receive the total amount of money in their Pay Pal account.
If a player leaves earlier the game, he/she will not lose any of their money.
-The game: The player that creates the game (the host) is going to be always the one that starts the play. The next player to play is going to be the first one that joins the game, the third player is going to be the second one that joins the game and so on. Everybody will start the game on the corner marked “GO”, then you will have to tap the button “Roll die” to know which is going to be your next position. 
You are allowed to buy “properties” or “sponsors” from your first go.
-Go: Each time a player lands on or passes over “GO”, the bank will play him/her £20.
Baying a property: Whenever you land on an unowned property or sponsor, you will have the   option  to buy it from the Bank in the price showed on the screen. 
-Paying rent: Whenever you land on a property/sponsor owned by another player, the owner will  collect rent from you in accordance with the price printed on the property’s card.
-Jail: You land on “Jail” whenever you landed on the space marked “Go to Jail”. When you are sent to Jail, you are not able to collect your £20 salary that you usually receive from “Go”.
You get out of Jail either by (1) staying there for 3 complete turns and being free in your 4th  turn or by (2) paying £50 to the bank.  If you land in Jail in the ordinary course of the game, you are “just visiting” so you incur no penalty and you are free to leave in your next turn.
-Free parking & arrows in the board: When a player lands on this places, he/she doesn’t receive  any reward of any kind. Is just a free resting place.
-Bankruptcy: A player is declared bankrupt if he/she owes more than he/she can pay.Great Uni Hackathon 2015Alicia Beylan

It works by creating an account and making a bet, where you define the parameters for the bet; i.e. real or fake currency and what the betting statement is. The bet information will be stored in the MySQL database and will by importing into a table which the user can see. The aim is for friends to be invited and bet against each other, where the bet creater acts as a referee and decides the winner(s).Our team was of 4 people, 2 front-end and 2 back-end. However, as of Saturday our team only consisted of 2 people - the front-end developers. This means we have all the pages of the site designed, with working popups and features. However, we have the functionality lacking in the website, due to the lack of back-end developers during this process. 
This is probably the biggest challenge myself and my colleague faced, as we had to take upon a greater role of writing MySQL code, which was foreign to both of us.We were proud to produce something we visualised in our minds, to make the website look the way we want without compromise.I learned that I should know back-end technologies as much as I do front-end, so I do not have to rely on other people.We hope to finish and implement the features we had planned, which include a link to facebook and a real currency (using brain-tree)Great Uni Hackathon 2015It was my first Hackathon and I had a lot of fun using Bootstrap CSS to make the website as nice as I could!I was the second front-end developer, using Bootstrap and CSS.

This client application is what sits on the party hosts laptop - responsible for organising and playing back the top rated tracks via Spotify. Trello-based playlist display and Twilio based song preview mechanisms also interact with the server side component.Last minute changes to communications libraries (a switch from 0MQ to Redis with 6 hours to go!). Initial trouble with LayerShift platform, and the various APIs/technologies (most notably OAuth troubles, and an extremely basic Spotify desktop API) - many of which were completely new to the team. All this along with the usual sleep deprivation made for an 'interesting' 36 hours!I feel very proud of the feature set we were able to put together in the time period, especially given the difficulties we faced. The breadth, and non-standard use of the APIs we chose presented an impressive challenge - and we are very pleased with our performance.Importance of focussing on core features, before branching out into 'stretch goals'. Coordination of individual work, to prevent overlap.Cleanup of code base prior to hopeful release as open source project. Hopefully has a bright future at student parties for many years to come!Great Uni Hackathon 2015George Vanburgh

This meant that we could only test it a limited number of times, and had to be certain of our code. We couldnt afford to make careless mistakes.We are proud of how we have managed to control the drone.

There are a number of 5 to 10 auctions a day during which Buckets of goods are bought. Out of a bucket you have details(description and photo) of only three of these the rest of them are unknow items or maybe the BIG DEAL! The Big Deal is announced in the morning but no one knows in which of the buckets it is.One of the challenges that we run into was to estamblish the paypal payment system. Another problem was to think about a system that is not too risky and makes people want to bid even if there is a chance of losing money. This is why our current version is not the one that we started with.With out current version even if people lose money they always get something out of their trade.We are proud that we managed to create a easy to use platform with a straight forward design.I learned what is the main process of developing a paypal payment system, how to estamblish a layershift server, how to work on git different branches without affecting the master branch, what bloomberg is and how to play warewolf.We are thinking of going further with the development, build dynamic auction rooms, implement esential features, think about who could provide the goods that are used (external vendors or find finances to buy our own goods).P.S.: Our application is using the LayerShift and Brain-Tree services.Great Uni Hackathon 2015I have worked both on the front-end and the back-end with special focus on JavaScript, jQuery and Ajax.I have developed part of the  back-end of the project in PHP as the login, logout, sessions and other various features related to the back-end.Back-end Developer, Front-end Developer.deleted deleted

You can choose from a range of available pokemon and use a variety of different moves with a variety of animations.The environment was developed by us throughout the hackathon. The pokemon were built from 3D models that we rigged and animated ourselves. The gameplay initiates when at least two Oculus rift users join the server. The users pick their pokemon and battle in VR.For all of the team members, this was the first time to ever use Unity. Working with a tool that we did not quite know how to use was demanding. We also faced a challenge communicating information between users on unity. Many of us were also new to game development.Learning Unity and Blender in less than 24 hours and achieving significant progress with both.Game development, Graphics and Design, Animations, P2P architectures.Hopefully we will expand it further to include a wider range of pokemon and moves that will allow the game to be as close as possible to the existing games.

Should you ask for a mobile phone? Email address? Or maybe Skype nickname? Whatever way you choose, you will still find yourself linking that person on more social media afterwards. Why not do it in one go with an easy-to-use app?What if you have to meet new people for business all the time? Then, your life turns into endless flow of business cards with no real structure and a simple way to organise it! Our app aims to become your electronic business card library and your business card on the go: search both your home and work contacts easily and have your business card with you wherever you go. Avoid the hassle with paper business cards!A person downloads an app and goes through a simple sign-up process that allows to add personal and work contacts like Facebook, LinkedIn etc. (only Email Address is implemented right now). Afterwards, the person takes a personal picture to be used for face recognition (in future, the Face Recognition library will be also filled up with profile images from added social networks). Ready to go!Recognising someone and adding a their contacts is as easy as taking a picture of that person!Face recognition doesn't really work well - different camera configurations, different lighting or even haircut and glasses screwed up the process. Thus, in the future, we need to add more reliable identification techniques like Fingerprint recognition (when the devices are equipped appropriately) with a fallback to techniques like NFC, Bluetooth or QR Code scanning.Having a centralised server for all the functionality means that we can roll out updates and have total control over the core of our app. However, it also means that the app can't function offline or if the server goes down. Meanwhile, doing Face recognition on the device is difficult due to all the SDKs out there (some of which are limited to the processor chips, e.g., Snapdragon SDK).Using Ionic and Cordova for making an app was a really good choice due to rapid view design process, but the framework sometimes behaves unexpectedly on the actual device. Lack of on-device JavaScript debugging makes development quite a horrifying process.We were advised to have a look at Parse backend-as-a-service and it worked out really great for us. Our backend server is just a single file with less than 250 lines of code!Doing a complex app that interacts with a server, uses camera and Face recognition only by means of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript is exciting and is quite an accomplishment on its own. A couple of years ago we never could imagine using thick technology stack in such a way!We had no prior experience in Ionic or Face recognition, so we learnt a great deal. We applied Ionic framework to bootstrap a simple cross-platform app really quickly. We discovered Parse - great alternative to managing your own database. We figured out the ins and outs of Face recognition with current technologies.Refactoring! And lots of it! App in it's current state is very much a fragile prototype, so we need to improve it's code quality. Changing the app engine from Ionic to something like Xamarin.Forms (more native yet still cross-platform) will improve the performance and may give us a chance to use the some on-device Face recognition techniques.Adding more contact sources will always remain needed (especially right now, when we only have a single email) - integration with all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ (for personal contacts) and LinkedIn (for work contacts) is crucial.What if you already have a collection of Business Cards? We could use Artificial Intelligence to smartly recognise your collection of paper Business Cards and automatically create an electronic entry with all the details (Name, Email, Age etc.)Limiting ourselves to Business Cards for people is quite boring! We could use the renowned iBeacon technology to implement Business Cards for Places. Why not add your favourite food place while you're there to keep track of latest updates and deals? :)Great Uni Hackathon 2015Eric Hripko

So we decided to build a virtual environment where you can challenge your friends to pokemon battles. You can choose from a range of available pokemon and use a variety of different moves with a variety of animations.The environment was developed by us throughout the hackathon. The pokemon were built from 3D models that we rigged and animated ourselves. The gameplay initiates when at least two Oculus rift users join the server. The users pick their pokemon and battle in VR.For all of the team members, this was the first time to ever use Unity. Working with a tool that we did not quite know how to use was demanding. We also faced a challenge communicating information between users on unity. Many of us were also new to game development.Learning Unity and Blender in less than 24 hours and achieving significant progress with both.Game development, Graphics and Design, Animations, P2P architectures.Hopefully we will expand it further to include a wider range of pokemon and moves that will allow the game to be as close as possible to the existing games.

Should you ask for a mobile phone? Email address? Or maybe Skype nickname? Whatever way you choose, you will still find yourself linking that person on more social media afterwards. Why not do it in one go with an easy-to-use app?What if you have to meet new people for business all the time? Then, your life turns into endless flow of business cards with no real structure and a simple way to organise it! Our app aims to become your electronic business card library and your business card on the go: search both your home and work contacts easily and have your business card with you wherever you go. Avoid the hassle with paper business cards!A person downloads an app and goes through a simple sign-up process that allows to add personal and work contacts like Facebook, LinkedIn etc. (only Email Address is implemented right now). Afterwards, the person takes a personal picture to be used for face recognition (in future, the Face Recognition library will be also filled up with profile images from added social networks). Ready to go!Recognising someone and adding a their contacts is as easy as taking a picture of that person!Face recognition doesn't really work well - different camera configurations, different lighting or even haircut and glasses screwed up the process. Thus, in the future, we need to add more reliable identification techniques like Fingerprint recognition (when the devices are equipped appropriately) with a fallback to techniques like NFC, Bluetooth or QR Code scanning.Having a centralised server for all the functionality means that we can roll out updates and have total control over the core of our app. However, it also means that the app can't function offline or if the server goes down. Meanwhile, doing Face recognition on the device is difficult due to all the SDKs out there (some of which are limited to the processor chips, e.g., Snapdragon SDK).Using Ionic and Cordova for making an app was a really good choice due to rapid view design process, but the framework sometimes behaves unexpectedly on the actual device. Lack of on-device JavaScript debugging makes development quite a horrifying process.We were advised to have a look at Parse backend-as-a-service and it worked out really great for us. Our backend server is just a single file with less than 250 lines of code!Doing a complex app that interacts with a server, uses camera and Face recognition only by means of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript is exciting and is quite an accomplishment on its own. A couple of years ago we never could imagine using thick technology stack in such a way!We had no prior experience in Ionic or Face recognition, so we learnt a great deal. We applied Ionic framework to bootstrap a simple cross-platform app really quickly. We discovered Parse - great alternative to managing your own database. We figured out the ins and outs of Face recognition with current technologies.Refactoring! And lots of it! App in it's current state is very much a fragile prototype, so we need to improve it's code quality. Changing the app engine from Ionic to something like Xamarin.Forms (more native yet still cross-platform) will improve the performance and may give us a chance to use the some on-device Face recognition techniques.Adding more contact sources will always remain needed (especially right now, when we only have a single email) - integration with all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ (for personal contacts) and LinkedIn (for work contacts) is crucial.What if you already have a collection of Business Cards? We could use Artificial Intelligence to smartly recognise your collection of paper Business Cards and automatically create an electronic entry with all the details (Name, Email, Age etc.)Limiting ourselves to Business Cards for people is quite boring! We could use the renowned iBeacon technology to implement Business Cards for Places. Why not add your favourite food place while you're there to keep track of latest updates and deals? :)Great Uni Hackathon 2015Eric Hripko

Data mining and visualisation for broadening access to cool tech eventsThis was my first hackathon event, and I was immediately struck by how skilled and interested people were in tech. I love how hackathon events have recently exploded in popularity, but I think that promoting access to these events in super techy (but less advantaged) areas of Europe is important.I built a web crawler (Python, scrapy package) to get hackathon locations from the last 1.5 years from the hackerleague website. This didn't actually work out (curse dynamically loaded pages!), so I had to clean and regex some raw text data. Using R, I could visualise where hackathons are held across Europe and how often.Next, I wanted to build up a Europe-wide map of tech interest. I did this by mining tweets that had keywords such as ""hacking"", ""coding"", ""programming"" and ""analytics"" and visualising them on a map of Europe (the Twitter mining was done both using the arcgis/esi map tool and by building a Twitter bot in Python). This let me see where there exist populations of techy geeks, and allowed me to compare it to the distribution of hackathon events.Finally, using the arcgis tool, I could visualise economic prosperity across regions in Europe and also compare this to provision of hackathons.Too many to list. Most notable among these is the difficulty of web crawling dynamically loaded pages and the lack of documentation for fetching information from json format tweets in python. I had to use workaround solutions for both of these problems (good old data cleaning and regex in both cases).I built my first ever web crawler, and my first ever Twitter bot! I did not actually think that I would have the time to teach myself these things and implement them within a day. Pleased with myself level: Kanye West.I mostly code in R, and typically only use Python for support tasks like restructuring weird data into nicer formats before I can upload it into a relational database. This project completely put me outside of my comfort zone and I've learned a lot.Most importantly, I need to figure out how to properly overlay the information sources so I can make prettier visualisations and analyse them quantitatively. Quantitative information would also allow us to track any effects of holding a hackathon in less catered to and advantaged areas (example sensationalist headline: ""holding a hackathon in a poorer area increases tech-related tweets by 400% for 1 month!""). The twitter json result processing needs some serious love - this would involve using a proper json decoder rather than simple text mining. Also, the hackathon event data is probably quite incomplete and should be aggregated from multiple sources rather than just hackerleague.MLH LandingNatasha Latysheva

Our pebble app hastily passes along the request to our backend, hammering away at the Bloomberg API, stripping it to it's core.
