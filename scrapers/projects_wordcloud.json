We  intended for the experience to be in VR, however we were unable to rent any of the hardware for the project. We adapted our ideas to  them  with the equipment available to us. The most challenging problem that we had was to keep an open connection between the database and Unity, as the script was making a call to the database once each frame (about 60 calls per second). We managed to reduce the number of calls made and to keep the connection open for the duration of the experience.\n\nWe are very proud of being able to put together a good range of functioning and high-level technology in order to create a smooth synergistic experience.  the 's heart rate to evaluate how the experience should change was challenging but was extremely rewarding to watch.

By  this API, our program takes messages, posts, and comments online and is able to return a Boolean value based on the different emotional levels of the text - either the post is suitable or it should be blocked. This was achieved by  a Python Flask back-end to carry out this function, and a java-script google chrome extension client-side to allow access in the browser. \nThe primary challenge was accurately identifying the posts that were suitable as opposed to the posts that were classified as harassment and so should be blocked. This was achieved  a comparison of the results given by IBM Watson's T analyser, results are given as different levels of emotions in the provided text - for example Fear or Anger. By comparing the positive emotions to the negative s, we were able to identify which posts were harassment and which were not with a reasonable level of accuracy. \nIn the process we have become experienced with the creation of Google Chrome Extensions as well as the difficulties of identifying negative content online. \nTo futher the harassment blocker project, ideas would include implementation in other browsers, and most importantly, development of our own algorithms to identify harassment rather than reliance on a outside API.

We really thought we could learn a lot from completing this project.\n\nThere is a webcam live feed that takes a snapshot when the door bell rings. It detects the face of person or multiple persons with the click of a button, and sends the detected image to the \"owner\" via email. \n\nWe started with a raw javascript webcam script that accessed the video tag of HTML5. In order to capture stills we had to change focus to angularJS to create our own webcam tag. In order to get around security problems of writing to disc\nthis webcam module must be hosted on a HTTP Server, we  be  python SimpleHTTPServer. Upon capturing a still, the image is sent to our own python server that we coded to accept a base64 string representation of an image. This is the medium through which we needed to send our image. Our server decodes the image and writes to disc. Our next python script takes said image from file store and s the openCV API to detect any faces. If multiple faces are detected a separate image file is created for each. Finally we have a script that sends the cropped image to a (person whose door this is) via email. \n\nNever  angularJS and the openCV before so the syntax was challenging to get our heads around at first.

By  this API, our program takes messages, posts, and comments online and is able to return a Boolean value based on the different emotional levels of the text - either the post is suitable or it should be blocked. This was achieved by  a Python Flask back-end to carry out this function, and a java-script google chrome extension client-side to allow access in the browser. \nThe primary challenge was accurately identifying the posts that were suitable as opposed to the posts that were classified as harassment and so should be blocked. This was achieved  a comparison of the results given by IBM Watson's T analyser, results are given as different levels of emotions in the provided text - for example Fear or Anger. By comparing the positive emotions to the negative s, we were able to identify which posts were harassment and which were not with a reasonable level of accuracy. \nIn the process we have become experienced with the creation of Google Chrome Extensions as well as the difficulties of identifying negative content online. \nTo futher the harassment blocker project, ideas would include implementation in other browsers, and most importantly, development of our own algorithms to identify harassment rather than reliance on a outside API.

Upon capturing a still, the image is sent to our own python server that we coded to accept a base64 string representation of an image. This is the medium through which we needed to send our image. Our server decodes the image and writes to disc. Our next python script takes said image from file store and s the openCV API to detect any faces. If multiple faces are detected a separate image file is created for each. Finally we have a script that sends the cropped image to a (person whose door this is) via email. \n\nNever  angularJS and the openCV before so the syntax was challenging to get our heads around at first.

Although I question the legitimacy of this claim, I am convinced that censorship is not the way to defeat online and offline harassment.\n\nThe Android keyboard (soft input device) that we developed is based off an older version of the vanilla keyboard. It reads and temporarily stores a buffer of the last 30 characters typed with it, and analyzes it against a dictionary of words that might be  to harass some. The list, for the purpose of this project, has been kept as family friendly as possible, and is more of a demonstration of the potential capabilities of software like this. The software briefly interrupts with a message to the  typing, when it deems that potential harassment may occur as result of the message.\n\nWe built the application by  an older version of the vanilla Android soft input device, that is available on the Google Git. We did an override of the method calls that it s to the system, and added our own code into it. We  Android Studio for that purpose. \n\nUnderstanding how the original keyboard ed was the main challenge for our group. N of us are active android developers, but we think that it is worth it to convey our idea in some way.\n\nManaging to  the  typing think twice about what they are sending without censoring their text, and without being too disruptive to the typing process itself.\n\nWe learned a lot about the android services and activities lifecycles, and how an android application s internally in general.\n Harassment Filter Android Keyboard\nWe would love to see opportunities to develop this idea into a finished product, with proper natural language recognition algorithms, that would void the need to  phrase dictionaries.",

Then, when 10 PM comes rolling around, you can ask your Amazon Echo to speak out the recipe.\n\nStarting from a Material Design CSS template, we designed a responsive web application with a PHP backend. Behind the scenes, we keep track of  accounts and store food plans in an SQL database. We process this information on the fly with PHP to calculate recipes and shopping lists.\nWe  integrate with Amazon's Alexa Skills API, which required two parts. On Amazon's developer console, we defined the interaction model and recognised phrases for the skill. Secondly, our server listens for HTTP requests from Alexa, processes the information, and returns a JSON-formatted response.\n\nHaving only begun  on the project during the Hackathon, it was a challenge to handle the tricky and poorly documented Alexa APIs, in a short amount of time. It was  incredibly difficult to debug the PHP behind Alexa, as Amazon's error message gave us no insight into the problems.\n\nWe are very pleased with the fact that our app \"Just s\". With a fully functional  account system, and a flawless integration with Alexa, MegaBite is more than a minimum viable product.\n\ning with voice interaction was an interesting experience. We learned how to deal with the ambiguities of the English language when defining the Echo's interaction model. On the other end of the line, we  had to write our responses in ways that Alexa could successfully speak out loud.\n MegaBite\nThe road ahead for MegaBite is full of possibilities.

To allow time for this, we  a combination of chaining callback functions, and  'promises' in JavaScript where appropriate.

It may  be displeasing for the  to hear such a wide varation in songs.\n\nContextualShuffle loads the entirety of your music library and learns associations between specific categories of music.  these categories and other song-specific features such valence, tempo, and genre, similarities are identified between other songs in your library, without any intervention on your part. Similar songs are then queued (shuffled) such that the genre or other features of importance does not vary too much from song to song. \nBy monitoring the 's facial expressions, the efficacy of the queuing system is further adapted and improved each iteration.\n\nStarting with the initial aim of identifying similar songs, a large music dataset was required. We sought to acquire features and labels that were most relevant for every track in the dataset. We identified the following features as critical in classification of each track: \n\nValence \nSpeechiness \nKey \nEnergy \nDanceability \nTempo \nGenre. \n\nAn ensemble of a 1000 decision trees was trained with boosting to extract feature importance, corresponding to the above features. The features were then normalized between -1 and 1 to allow for an easier evaluation.  the resulting features we calculated, the cross-correlation between different songs was calclated and an incrementally built list of succeedingly similar songs was continually adapted  positive and negative emotions determined by Microsoft's Cognitive API service. \nFollowing this, when a  plays a given song from their library, the most similar songs to each corresponding song are played successivelly. This means the first song's nearest neighbour is played. The neighbour then becomes the root from which calculations are considered, and it's nearest neighbour is played and so on. This provides a good balance of variation and consistency between tracks.\n\nOpenCV has posed multiple difficulties due to version compatibility and limited support for python 2.7. Even after installing it for  Python3 a large amount of time was needed for everythin to  as intended. \nThe Spotify API download rate has posed a significant problem due to the large amount of training data that was required by our algorithms.\nThe Azure API examples could improve in terms of documentation.\nRunning Webcams through virtual machines was nearly impossible, so we had to resort to communicating to external mobile devices.\nLabelling of genres, and appropriate mining of data was difficult to achieve due to \nCommunication between different technologies was difficult and rather consuming.\n\nWe believe this product is able, usable, and performs in-line with our initial aims and goals\nThe large amount of different technologies into the product has given us a brief but enjoyable experience with each of them.\nGenerating and creating able training and testing datasets given the large amonut of variables in a given track.\n\nAvoid OpenCV if possible.\nLearning about different APIs and libraries in order to achieve a niche task.\nKeep your front and back end separated if possible.\n ContextualShuffle\nWe'd love to reach out to the team at Spotify and discuss how our findings could help them improve their technologies and how additional features in their APIs could assist developers",

Once their 6 responses had been recorded, this data could be sent to the azure api, and in response the app would receive a \"worthit\" score for the person to keep drinking.\nTo start with s are asked what kind of drinker are they: light weight (penguin, cos feathers are light), heavy weight (bears, beca bears are bare heavy) and average (\"pengbears a cross between the two.\")\nI posted a survey to reddit where I asked  to describe their recent drinking experiences. They answered the same 6 questions as on the website, plus  evaluation question of how worth it the night was ( as the label score), These were  to train the algorithm, the higher the worth it score, the more likely my web app recommended to continue drinking.\n I ran into\nThe node.js was more rudimentary than I would have liked, I could not solve a bug that prevented browsers registering modified XHR, so the url could not be updated on the website. It was very frustrating as it was a matter of configuration of static files rather than something directly related to programming. This prevents multiple s  the website at once, or me exploring session data etc.\n that I'm proud of\nI managed to quickly get accurate outputs for a trained machine learning algorithm to  in the app, I really enjoyed developing the graphics and my \"pengbear\" is baller.\nWhat I learned\nI learned how to develop a node.js application with good structure between dynamic and static content.  how to call azure apis, and  their cognitive services. \n Should I go home?\nIn the future I would want to integrate it with the mobile platform, so that accelerometers could detect whether some was ignoring the apps advice, and based on that decide whether to help the student in the morning with \"how to deal with your hangover\" advice.  instead of training the API on such a small dataset, s would have the option to input their own experiences to add to the dataset or validate how effective the apps recommendations had been the morning after.\nWith a larger dataset, the number of possible questions could be far greater, including maths problems to evaluate somes current cognitive skills, and a small subset of these could be chosen, to keep the app interesting.",

On the screen the player sees himself in the video stream from the Kinect with the translated Chinese symbols overlaid on top. By extending the hand towards the screen each player can trace the Chinese characters. Traces of more than  player are displayed in different brush colours. At any point through the game, the Chinese characters and brush strokes can be cleared by saying \u201cCancel\u201d.\nIn game mode the player follows a both addictive and instructive story line that  teach some basic Chinese characters while the player fights his way from level to level to find the evil monster that has taken over Queen\u2019s Tower (an iconic structure at Imperial College London).\n\nWe built it  C#.

Some of them include realising that the J4K library doesn't support audio streaming... so 8 hours in, we had to scrap the old program and restart with C# instead of Java. Another challenge was that C# was a completely new programming language for 3 of the members.\n\nN of us knew each other before we formed the team during the hackathon and we all come from different discipline/university/year and we are proud that we got a fun  project completed essentially under 16 hours.

In some functions, we needed to pass  or more API calls, into another API call. Simply writing line by line would not have given the AJAX requests enough time to return their responses. To allow time for this, we  a combination of chaining callback functions, and  'promises' in JavaScript where appropriate. We  had to consider that sometimes, API requests do not come back successful, and we had to be ready to accept failed, or partial responses. The Expedia API, whilst containing very rich data, had a complex data structure which involved retrieving a 'LegID' from  area of the structure, and looking that ID up in another part.\nBeing first years and in our first hackathon, we  found the division of tasks and merging of code an interesting challenge, sometimes we had performed unit testing that had passed, and later found that when the functions were chained together, they often had unexpected edge cases that we had to account for. This required good planning and prior agreements of what data and arguments we would be passing to each other.\n\nOnly  of the members of our group had ever had experience with front end and web development.

It may  be displeasing for the  to hear such a wide varation in songs.\n\nContextualShuffle loads the entirety of your music library and learns associations between specific categories of music.  these categories and other song-specific features such valence, tempo, and genre, similarities are identified between other songs in your library, without any intervention on your part. Similar songs are then queued (shuffled) such that the genre or other features of importance does not vary too much from song to song. \nBy monitoring the 's facial expressions, the efficacy of the queuing system is further adapted and improved each iteration.\n\nStarting with the initial aim of identifying similar songs, a large music dataset was required. We sought to acquire features and labels that were most relevant for every track in the dataset. We identified the following features as critical in classification of each track: \n\nValence \nSpeechiness \nKey \nEnergy \nDanceability \nTempo \nGenre. \n\nAn ensemble of a 1000 decision trees was trained with boosting to extract feature importance, corresponding to the above features. The features were then normalized between -1 and 1 to allow for an easier evaluation.  the resulting features we calculated, the cross-correlation between different songs was calclated and an incrementally built list of succeedingly similar songs was continually adapted  positive and negative emotions determined by Microsoft's Cognitive API service. \nFollowing this, when a  plays a given song from their library, the most similar songs to each corresponding song are played successivelly. This means the first song's nearest neighbour is played. The neighbour then becomes the root from which calculations are considered, and it's nearest neighbour is played and so on. This provides a good balance of variation and consistency between tracks.\n\nOpenCV has posed multiple difficulties due to version compatibility and limited support for python 2.7. Even after installing it for  Python3 a large amount of time was needed for everythin to  as intended. \nThe Spotify API download rate has posed a significant problem due to the large amount of training data that was required by our algorithms.\nThe Azure API examples could improve in terms of documentation.\nRunning Webcams through virtual machines was nearly impossible, so we had to resort to communicating to external mobile devices.\nLabelling of genres, and appropriate mining of data was difficult to achieve due to \nCommunication between different technologies was difficult and rather consuming.\n\nWe believe this product is able, usable, and performs in-line with our initial aims and goals\nThe large amount of different technologies into the product has given us a brief but enjoyable experience with each of them.\nGenerating and creating able training and testing datasets given the large amonut of variables in a given track.\n\nAvoid OpenCV if possible.\nLearning about different APIs and libraries in order to achieve a niche task.\nKeep your front and back end separated if possible.\n ContextualShuffle\nWe'd love to reach out to the team at Spotify and discuss how our findings could help them improve their technologies and how additional features in their APIs could assist developers",

The results are calculated  a cognitive service regression algorithm, based off s past drinking experiences and how worth it they were.\nI think it has real application for the student market, excessive alcohol consumption is a problem, but no  wants to be controlled. Most PSAs are unappealing, and struggle to be relateable plus it's really hard to judge your drunkness levels even based on your own past experiences. \"Should I go home?\" removes these issues, giving a reliable, impartial source, informed by your peers past actions and has a fun, simple  interface.\nHow I built it\nThe web app was built  a combination of HTML, CSS, handlebars and node. As s would answer 6, multiple choice button questions. Its designed to be quick, simple and humourous to appeal to its target drunk, student audience. Once their 6 responses had been recorded, this data could be sent to the azure api, and in response the app would receive a \"worthit\" score for the person to keep drinking.\nTo start with s are asked what kind of drinker are they: light weight (penguin, cos feathers are light), heavy weight (bears, beca bears are bare heavy) and average (\"pengbears a cross between the two.\")\nI posted a survey to reddit where I asked  to describe their recent drinking experiences. They answered the same 6 questions as on the website, plus  evaluation question of how worth it the night was ( as the label score), These were  to train the algorithm, the higher the worth it score, the more likely my web app recommended to continue drinking.\n I ran into\nThe node.js was more rudimentary than I would have liked, I could not solve a bug that prevented browsers registering modified XHR, so the url could not be updated on the website. It was very frustrating as it was a matter of configuration of static files rather than something directly related to programming. This prevents multiple s  the website at once, or me exploring session data etc.\n that I'm proud of\nI managed to quickly get accurate outputs for a trained machine learning algorithm to  in the app, I really enjoyed developing the graphics and my \"pengbear\" is baller.\nWhat I learned\nI learned how to develop a node.js application with good structure between dynamic and static content.  how to call azure apis, and  their cognitive services. \n Should I go home?\nIn the future I would want to integrate it with the mobile platform, so that accelerometers could detect whether some was ignoring the apps advice, and based on that decide whether to help the student in the morning with \"how to deal with your hangover\" advice.  instead of training the API on such a small dataset, s would have the option to input their own experiences to add to the dataset or validate how effective the apps recommendations had been the morning after.\nWith a larger dataset, the number of possible questions could be far greater, including maths problems to evaluate somes current cognitive skills, and a small subset of these could be chosen, to keep the app interesting.",

    "project_description": "facejack\nyour face has been hijacked\nAbout FaceJack\nBackground\nMachine learning with deep neural nets (commonly dubbed \"deep learning\") has taken the world by storm, smashing record after record in a wide variety of difficult tasks from fields that were largely unexplored in previous years, such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing.  computer vision task that benefits from such clear gains is facial recognition (identifying a person based on his/her face)---a deep neural net being the primary tool  for this purpose at Facebook, among other places. \n natural extension of the above could be to exploit neural nets within a secure application, in order to authenticate a person based on a shot of their face. Unfortunately, despite the apparently superb performance of such models, it is fairly easy to construct inputs which can trick the net into authenticating a stranger (commonly known as adversarial examples). We built FaceJack in order to illuminate this concept. In particular, we'd like to emphasise:\n\nhow simple it is to generate such \"fooling\" inputs algorithmically, if  has access to the neural net  for facial recognition (either directly or through an API).\nhow imperceptibly close the \"fooling\" inputs can be to legitimately generated inputs;\nhow this attack may be executed in real-time, requiring only a mid-range GPU.\n\nBut let's take it slowly---what even are adversarial inputs?\nAdversarial training\nAdversarial inputs are made possible by the very design of neural nets. On a high level, a neural net consumes an input, performs several transformations to it, in order to predict a corresponding output. The net parameters are adjusted by running the net on a training set (a set of known input/output pairs from which the net needs to generalise). The net's transformations are designed to be differentiable, so that the net can be efficiently trained by:\n\nFeeding an input to the net, computing a prediction\nComputing an error of the prediction with respect to the expected output\nPropagating the error backwards through the net, updating parameters as we go.\n\nThe net's differentiability allows us to consider the error function in its parameters, for a fixed input and output---so we can optimise them. However, it  allows us to set up an error function in the input, for a fixed choice of parameters---so we can modify the input to produce a desirable output. If the \"desirable\" output classification is  that the original input does not belong to (e.g. classifying my face as John Travolta), then the constructed input represents an adversarial example. Deep neural nets are particularly vulnerable to such inputs, for three main reasons:\n\nComputing an adversarial example usually only requires a crude approximation of the gradient of the desired output with respect to the input image---often, only the sign of this gradient for each input pixel is sufficient.\nThe computed adversarial examples are often imperceptibly similar to the original input---in fact, there is an entire space of adversarial inputs surrounding any correctly classified image, as Szegedy et al. have demonstrated in 2013.\nEven worse---what's adversarial for  net architecture  very often be adversarial for a completely different net as well---as they are often trained on the same datasets!\n\nTherefore,  neural nets in secure applications requires particular care, as adversarial inputs give rise to a potentially unforeseen covert channel for an exploit.\nWhat have we d?\nWe have built FaceJack as a simple representative of such an exploit: \n\nWe have fine-tuned a deep convolutional neural net (CNN) based on the VGG-face architecture, in order to authenticate  of our team members (Laurynas) as an administrator of a secure system;\nThe authentication system leverages a laptop web cam---detected faces in the camera's view are submitted to the net for classification;\nWe have planted a \"hack switch\", capable of intercepting the input and performing adversarial training on it before submitting it for classification---this resulted in a 100% success rate for authenticating as Laurynas, regardless of your facial features.\n\nHopefully, FaceJack has achieved its objective of highlighting this important issue in a clear and concise fashion. We hope to expand it in the near future with further authentication attacks, for example speech recognition-based s.\nLicense\nMIT\n(CCTV Icon made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com)",

In\ncase of a fall, seniors who receive help within an hour have a better rate of survival and, the faster\nhelp arrives, the less likely an injury  lead to hospitalization or the need to move into a long-term\ncare facility. In such cases fast visual detection of abnormal motion patterns is crucial. \nIn this project we propose the  of a novel embedded Dynamic Vision Sensor (eDVS) for the task of classifying falls. Opposite from\nstandard cameras which provide a time sequenced stream of frames, the eDVS provides only relative\nchanges in a scene, given by individual events at the pixel level.  this different encoding scheme\nthe eDVS brings advantages over standard cameras. First, there is no redundancy in the data received\nfrom the sensor, only changes are reported. Second, as only events are considered the eDVS data rate is\nhigh. Third, the power consumption of the overall system is small, as just a low-end microcontroller is\n to fetch events from the sensor and can ultimately run for long time periods in a battery powered\nsetup. This project investigates how can we exploit the eDVS fast response time and low-redundancy\nin making decisions about elderly motion. \nThe computation backend  be realized with a neural net classificator to detect fall and filter outliers.

We should be spending our time on the things that matter - learning with greater depth or spending quality time with our friends. \nImprovable is a platform which takes care of this for you - it learns about you as you learn about the world. It provides you with practice questions for your exams and knows what you are good at and bad at, adapting to your abilities and reinforcing the concepts you have freshly learnt through personalised notifications.\nBut what good is that in a boring interface?

Scoring is based on each session and provides a dynamic, interactive and accurate metric for fast and motivating feedback.\n\nDistilling the ethos of every inspiring teacher-pupil relationship was at the heart of Improvable. From then, we've tessellated, out, creating complex ORIGAMI folds, adding humour and personality to solid facts whilst keeping the interface fresh, crisp and as sharp as an ARGON bulb. Each of the four stages has been carefully crafted before being PUSHed to fulfil the gestalt of what learning can be.  a powerful MICROSOFT azure server, Improvable was designed to be fast and responsive, giving the student full responsibility and MANpower over the STUDIO of study. \n\nWe changed our ideas midway after realising that creating a learning buddy would be much more interactive and intuitive than our initial straight-laced platform, and had to quickly adjust our mindset and code. What better way would there be than for the student to forge their own path of discovery of learning?\nWe wanted to allow the writer free reign over the product, with natural language of their own - this proved to be a challenge that needed pure PUSHERS to overcome in pure javascript. \n\nOur learning buddy has spread joy and knowledge to the  around us.

We believe that the  experience of the visually impaired would be greatly enhanced by providing feedback through facial recognition and interpretation of the expressions of the  they are talking to. \n\neMotion aims to address the lack of support for the visually impaired by harnessing a Microsoft Cognitive API to provide real-time information on facial expressions during a video call.

    "project_description": "\nGiven recent events, we feel it is important for Durham students to find their way home safely after a night out. With the release of lots of data by Durham County Council, we thought this provided an opportunity to improve the safety of students in Durham.\n\nAfter a heavy night out, it's important to get home safe. This means following lit streets - and, particularly in Durham - staying away from the river, and being conscious of traffic. Get Home Safe combines the familiarity and ubiquity of Google Maps with never-before-seen data points from Durham County Council to show clubbers the safest route home after a night out.\nGet Home Safe highlights the density of streetlights and traffic across County Durham to visually indicate to the  the safest path through the city.\n\nGet Home Safe is a web app  node.js and MySQL on the backend, and revolves largely around the free Google Maps API on the frontend. Each team member took care of separate parts of the project, including developing the backend, populating the database, interpreting and visualising the data, and taking care of the front end. \nOur database contains approximately 80,000 entries - each representing the coordinates of a street light in County Durham. Upon loading the web app, the backend dynamically sends the required entries to the , depending on their map viewport. \n\n of the initial  was converting the data into a usable format. The coordinates had to be bulk converted from 'easting and northing' format to 'longitude and latitude', which is no small task when there are 80,000 points to convert! We then had to load these into the database, which proved to be difficult due to the sheer number of entries.\nAnother idea we had was to reduce the number of data points with a clustering algorithm. However, due to time constraints, it proved unfeasible to comprehend all the complex modules and techniques that would be required.\nWe attempted to map each data point to a street - this in itself proved difficult due to the method by which Google Maps stores information about its streets and the sheer processing power this would require.\nWe  Google's API to plot lines on the roads that were lit (i.e. that had street lights on them), and this  (although incomplete) can be seen on the Lit Roads page.\n\nOur interface is  friendly, responsive and well optimised. Having a nearly finished - and, crucially, usable - product in such a short space of time is something to be proud of, and we feel that our product could be tweaked and released as a commercial app. \nThe map data is surprisingly responsive - by dynamically loading the data points that are needed and then  Google's API to convert this to a heatmap means the  d by the browser is far less than that if we were to load all 80,000 data points into the webpage.\n\n Git is something many of us had not experienced before, but now we feel we have a certain level of ability and are able to  it in future projects.\nnode.js runs the backend of our project, and we have learnt more about making a 'static' site  Express.\nWe learnt adaptable skills in how to take third party APIs and put these together to realise a complete idea. \n Get Home Safe\nThe plan is to further develop the Lit Roads idea, to best show the  the safest route home. We could  further optimise the site to  on small mobile devices. \nWe could even  more data from other county councils to expand our reach, or to include other Durham data such as footfall, and combine all this to find even safer routes home.",

This can be especially dangerous if you have to go through dark wooded areas of if you are by yourself. \nMany times I have had to take my friends home on a 30minute walk or just stumbled across collapsed men and women in the street who were too drunk to go home. The student union had an answer to this. A night bus, it would pick you up no matter where you are and take you home for \u00a32. Problem is that is not advertised well (ask any if they know what it is, they likely won't - the number is hidden on a 95 page document), notoriously difficult to get hold of and not very  friendly to  (you have to describe where you are to the driver over the ph = nightmare). Factor in the fact that your drunk and you can see why students don't  this excellent service and put themselves at risk by going home. \nThe night bus is the safe way for l students to get around Durham safely:\nWhen studying late in the library to get home\nTo get to and from the train station late at night\nTo travel between colleges\nTo get to or from late bars and nightclubs\nYou\u2019re visiting friends\nAt the cinema or theatre\n\nDUber is essentially an SOS get me home now app. Let me set the scene, a student on night out decided that it would be wise to down a bottle of vodka and now needs to head home. He lives in the hill college, half an hour away. He pulls out the app, hits the pick me up button. The nightbus driver is pinged his picture, location and the student is given an ETA. The driver and the student both get eachothers numbers and can contact eachother if the student or driver can't find each other. The App handles the payment and whether the student paid. We get all the data from CIS so the driver and the union know exactly who are  the service.\n\nThe app consists of two major compnts. An app which the driver and student   and a PHP REST API. The API scrapes the student data from Durham name and password and handles all the DB operations and provides the endpoints which the app relies on.\n\nOperating around the constrains of the universities systems was the only challenge we faced. Trying to get a way to authenticated on Durham's portal  students passwords and name was quite a challenge.

We build the front end in ES6 Javascript,  the pug templating language.\n\n\nFiguring out how to scrape relevant information from websites\nConnecting with the Digital Bible Platform API for verse text\nRepresenting Bible Verses and range selections in the database\nComplexity of setting up a front end frame\nTranslating mockup details to prototype\n\n\n\nclean design\n\n Scripturally Sound\nWe plan on building the database to be robust, with thousands of songs, and more scriptures per song. We  create an API that would show the lyric to scripture relationship line by line, and create lyric inspired-bible studies for subscribers. Scripturally Sound could potentially be referenced by Christian music artist after their concerts, providing their fans with a biblical resource that allows them to grow deeper spiritually. It can scale to be a resource for Christian schools K-12, filmrs who need songs to for movie scores, and for worship schools.

The main reason for that it this sector requires river flow as the most important Essential climate Variable, and this variable should be generated with hydrological models, that requires a lot of information (land s, digital elevation model, etc.) However, two projects are providing this information (in demo mode). SWICCA (Service for Water Indicators in Climate Change Adaptation) offers readily available climate-impact data to speed up the flow in climate-change adaptation of water management across Europe.

When a player hits a wall, they lose a unit of their length until they \"die\". Players gain units of length by eating apples and can obtain a temporary speed boost power-up.

    "project_description": "\nThe original idea for roombox came from a common frustration at parties - every loves Spotify, but why doesn't it allow other  to queue songs in a playlist? Eventually, we became fed up with constantly queueing songs for others, and decided to build roombox, a simple room-based queueing system for Spotify.\n\nroombox allows s to create password-protected rooms, which in turn creates a playlist in their Spotify account. Other  can then join that room and queue songs into that playlist - the idea being that Spotify plays through whatever has been queued in order, removing the need for some to oversee the music.\n\nFor the backend, we  Flask - a powerful template-driven Python web frame designed with modularity and scalability in mind. This allowed us to build roombox up from just a home page without really needing to modify our existing code. This definitely made the development process go a little more smoothly, as well as providing a lot of ful inbuilt stuff.\nFor the frontend, we elected to  a frame called MaterializeCSS - this was perfect for a variety of reasons:\n\nIt allowed us to have a site which ed well on both mobile and desktop browsers.\nIt allowed us to create a site with a very clean, minimal design.\nMaterializeCSS has toast notifications built in - we  a Flask template to effectively create a \"message handler\" for Flask messages, which let us create toast notifications  only Flask's inbuilt flash() function.\nIt removed a lot of the guess involved in creating a usable layout; most of the elements arrange themselves into a neat layout without much  on our part.\n\n\nHstly, the development went quite smoothly all things considered. We ran into an issue where a bug in our code ca the database into an odd state, resulting in errors when performing queries - beca we weren't storing any valuable data at that stage in development, we could  around the problem by deleting the database until we fixed the bug. In general, we found that database management was the most difficult part of the project to implement. Aside from that, there were no show-stopping issues, and we were able to get roombox finished relatively quickly.\n\n\nThe server is resource-efficient enough that it runs fairly quickly with memory to spare inside the cheapest available DigitalOcean droplet ($5/mo for 512MB RAM, 20GB SSD and 1 vCore). If we run into performance issues as time goes on, we may consider upgrading, but for now it s fine.\nWe were able to get the project finished in just over 12 hours - this left us plenty of time to squish any minor bugs and usability issues that we found with the project after that point.\n\n\nDeveloping roombox taught us a lot about front-end development more than anything; making sure the site was straightforward, ensuring the next steps were obvious, et cetera. We found that a lot of our time was spent rearranging things on the frontend to remove unnecessary steps, and fixing usability issues with the layout (like putting the search bar above the queue, where previously it was below and could end up off-screen). Additionally, it was nice to learn how the Spotify Web API s, and we learned a lot about how to  requests (and parse the response)  the popular requests library available on pip.\n roombox\nWe have thrown around the idea of preparing roombox for public  - the idea seems to be popular with  who have had it demonstrated to them, and the site is pretty close to being ready for public consumption - we just need to finish implementing little \"polish\" things (like auto playlist deletion after a given time, and the ability for the host to delete things from the queue).",

We  endeavoured to implement the Twitter and GitHub APIs. We allowed s to store what they wanted to document in MongoDB, and endeavoured to parse Twitter and GitHub data into this database too.\n\nMaking sense of both the Twitter API and GitHub API were a challenge.

It is always a pain to walk right up to it to change tracks, adjust the volume or start/stop playing. With HotPebble, there is a simple and seamless solution to manage your media experience.\n\n\nThere are two main compnts to this project, the client-side pebble application and the server scripts to handle client data. The client-side pebble application is built in pure C, the highest level language in the world ;). The server scripts are built in Python and caters separately to both macOS and Windows. The macOS scripts s Python libraries such as pyautogui and pynput, whereas the Windows scripts s the win32api.\nThe pebble app collects accelerometer data and performs on-device processing to eliminate jitter and smoothen out spikes in orientation values. The app then pipes the data via Bluetooth serial to a server listening on a laptop, which interprets the data to perform the various commands that HotPebble is capable of. This includes scrolling the active window, sending media keys such as Play/Stop, Next/Previous Track, volume control and simple presentation shortcuts.\n\nIt was a difficult process to connect pebble applications to non-mobile devices as there was no official API support for direct connection. We had to rely on an external Python library (libpebble2) to accomplish it. The documentation was not very extensive and not much resources/examples were available online. Therefore, we had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to implement the functionalities that we desire.\n\nIt was our first hackathon together as a team even though we had known each other for more than a year. It was an amazing experience as we got to learn about each other better. \nWe are super proud to have completed what we had set out to do. It  definitely be a memorable time and a start for many more great hackathon experiences to come.\n\nLearning to  well in a team. Finding arounds to technical obstacles that we face.

Analyses photos in the album and evaluates emotions of  present on the photos. Plots a point on a 2D map and displays information about the event gathered from the Emotions API.\n\nA broad overview of our application is basically getting all the photos from Facebook and then passing the links on to the backend for further processing. The backend calls the Microsoft Cognitive API's for every image and does some minor data processing on the returned values and gives it back to the . But it was even harder to implement this simple flow. We started with just calling the cognitive api's through JavaScript but it took a lot of time to send all the images and do required calculations. So we thought of sending a message to an AWS SQS queue and wrote a Go server, which is attached to the queue and when it receives new messages, it calls the API for all the images concurrently thus bringing our execution time from about 10secs to 1-2secs. Apart from that we run node.js server on an EC2 instance and the frontend is written in Angular.js, HTML5 and CSS.\n\nThe major  were basically related to concurrency in Go, eliminating data races, avoiding null pointers and reduce the number of goroutines.  understanding the AWS SDK for Go lang was a big challenge and setting up the Simple Queue Service wasn't easy as well.\n\nEfficient  of multiple APIs and actually harnessing the power of Go and Amazon AWS.\n Hackathon Happiness\n registration, added functionality to save your map even when the session has expired.",

As a multidisciplinary team, we wanted to incorporate all 4 areas to create an app which helps mental health patients. Depression and anxiety disorder cost $1 trillion per year (WHO), so this app could have medical and financial implications.\nOur research indicated that mood diary apps currently on the market require individuals to input their own emotional state. Research has shown that patients with mental health difficulties may not perceive their own emotional state accurately. As a result, we wanted to  software to analyse this instead.\n\nThe app is a mood diary to monitor emotional states, allowing  to record their daily feelings and difficulties. This  feeds into Microsoft API to analyse text to check whether the sentiment was negative or positive, and offers advice for specific treatment goals. For example, it  direct patients displaying suicidal tendencies to the Samaritans hotline, provide patients with panic attacks management advice.\nIf patients have 7 negatives in a row, they are prompted to call their psychiatrist or a close family member/friend via the Dialler. If patients input positive entries, only these  be listed on the front page.\n\nWe planned on a white board for 2 hours to determine our main goals: a simple and accessible app. We built an Android app  Android Studio, and  Material Design combined with many libraries. This allowed us to  web Microsoft API (Text Analysis) for cognitive services. \n retrofit (a library for android development), we were able to send requests to the API, which gave us a sentiment score. This enabled us to know how positive/negative the  is feeling, as well as keywords to determine possible reasons for these extreme emotions. This prompted s with tailored advice.\nWe  this to display all positive stories on the front page, whilst hiding negative messages from sight. However, if the  entered a large number of negative messages over a long period of time, this could indicate deteriorating mental health. The Dialler would then be launched to contact a friend/doctor.\nWe  support libraries to  our application backward compatible, whilst still giving the material design to older phs. Libraries called RXJava and RXAndroid gave us cleaner code when developing.\nWe  Adobe Illustrator to design a Material Design inspired app icon, and generated multiple different pixel densities. This allows for the icon to be viewed on a greater number of devies.\n\nTiming was very difficult, as we had created an ambitious project with many goals. Furthermore, some of us had never coded before. We intended to  M, but we could not access the technology for the 24 hours. The Pebble watches did not have pulse detection so we could not incorporate this.\nWe tried to augment the new Microsoft API with IBM Watson T Analyser API, to give us a larger variety of emotions to select from. Potentially, this would have allowed us to assign percentages to measure the weighting of specific emotional states. However, due to the 24 hours time constraints, IBM were unable to accept our request for the beta trial in time.\n\nThree of us learnt how to code for the first time in only 24 hours at our very first hackathon. Our computer scientist learnt how to  the Microsoft API having never  it before. , he had never coded on Ubuntu Linux before during a hackathon.\n\nThose who had never coded before learnt basic programming skills, and our computer scientist learnt aspects of medicine and psychiatry.\n Mful\nIncorporate M technology to analyse strong emotions via brain activity, or measuring pulse via a smartwatch. These would prompt patients to open their diary and log a new entry via a notification. \nFurthermore, we would have liked to incorporate location features with SkyScanner API to allow individuals to recommend hotels, restaurants, doctors etc. for  with similar mental health conditions. , location features with Esri could allow individuals to form local support groups, which has been shown to be beneficial.\nWe would have liked to incorporate the Microsoft API more closely to pick up specific keywords, and offer even more specific tips to patients.

Wanted to produce a website that allowed anybody to do a magic trick with very little practice.  as a professional magician, and want to change my answer after I perform from, 'sorry, I can't tell you how I did that' to 'here's something that you can learn'.\n\n It's an online magic trick. Read the instructions page first if you are  it. A person thinks of a card, or three  ( picks the colour,  picks the suit,  picks the value), they can change their mind as much as they want and you do not influence their decision. Whatever they say, when you click on the link a picture of their chosen card comes up. \nHow I built it\n I  the code academy tutorial to learn how to initially write the basic code structure in html and css. Then I learnt how to put in the appropriate images and links onto the page, and on each letter. Didn't know what software to put the code that I had written into, so I just coded into the text file on my wordpress website on a new page. Started by coming up with a set of words that could be split into 4 instructions, to represent the four suits, with 13 characters in each instruction (minus spaces) to represent the 13 potential card values in each suit. Then coded each individual letter to correspond to each playing card (this took the bulk of the time as I had to attach an image link to every letter). I then reformatted all the information so that it was in  line as a sentence and added a title. Created a new instructions page and added a link to that. Then coded in the pictures and links, as well as centre lining the text and making it look nice. Finally I added a link from the instructions to my website (not coded during the hackathon), beca... why not right? \n I ran into\n The biggest challenge I faced was convincing myself to start learning to code, then it was ensuring that all of the code was formatted and the website looked nice. Coming up with the word combination was difficult, as was ensuring that the link looked as much like  single hyperlink as possible. \n that I'm proud of\n Finally got around to learning to code, and am now looking forward to  on many more exciting projects.  proud to have come up with the idea and then g on to execute it. Proud that it was all written in actual code rather than just editing the words on wordpress as I usually do with my website.\nWhat I learned\n How to  html/css. How to create headings, change font sizes, import images, add hyperlinks, add image hyperlinks, reformat code to become  sentence,  continuously for a few hours without procrastinating. \n Online Magic Trick - Amaze Your Friends\n Definitely going to design some more magic tricks that  can do for their friends  the platform.

In this game the character has to follow game hints that lead to the player answering the ph to a friend who sends information about the location of a portal to a magical world. The way 3d graphics engines  greatly interests me so for fun, instead of  a program like unity that does the 3d for you, for this project I aimed to create a 3d game  just JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, paint images and screenshots I would take of 3d objects.\n I created 3D objects  SkectchUp then screenshotted these scenery models from lots of different angles and  JavaScript and jQuery to control when these images were displayed to create a 3d game experience for the . I   Photoshop to  the images backgrounds transparent where appropriate. The game includes some third person scenes in which the players width and height is multiplied by scalar values based on its y-coordinate to create perspective and show when the player is close or far away. This scene  includes some quick first person moments which occur when an object of great importance to the games story appears and the  is able to view this item in first person. This was d to  sure the  sees this object up close and notices it. As the player opens the portal the world distorts a bit to empathise the magical powers of the portal. Magic dust  appears above the flashing portal. Once the portal is opened the magical world is all in first person. The player is transported to a magical castle which they can freely walk up and down  corridor of. The corridor appears clear at first but as soon as the player starts to walk an enchanted floating hat appears. \nWhen making the game I came across many .  of these was that the number of screenshots needed to  a smooth running 3D game was too large. I had to compromise and limit the number of images  to a reasonable number. I  struggled with problems ca by code written for different stages of the game affecting thing in a part of the game they were not intended for. The solution to this was to give each stage of the game a boolean variable that tracks if it should have started running yet or not. This helped me keep track of which stage of the game the  was in and what code should and shouldn\u2019t run for this stage of the game. \nThe main thing I leant was how to  the 3d for the first person scene in the game (in the castle scene).

Read the instructions page first if you are  it. A person thinks of a card, or three  ( picks the colour,  picks the suit,  picks the value), they can change their mind as much as they want and you do not influence their decision. Whatever they say, when you click on the link a picture of their chosen card comes up. \nHow I built it\n I  the code academy tutorial to learn how to initially write the basic code structure in html and css. Then I learnt how to put in the appropriate images and links onto the page, and on each letter. Didn't know what software to put the code that I had written into, so I just coded into the text file on my wordpress website on a new page. Started by coming up with a set of words that could be split into 4 instructions, to represent the four suits, with 13 characters in each instruction (minus spaces) to represent the 13 potential card values in each suit. Then coded each individual letter to correspond to each playing card (this took the bulk of the time as I had to attach an image link to every letter). I then reformatted all the information so that it was in  line as a sentence and added a title. Created a new instructions page and added a link to that. Then coded in the pictures and links, as well as centre lining the text and making it look nice. Finally I added a link from the instructions to my website (not coded during the hackathon), beca... why not right? \n I ran into\n The biggest challenge I faced was convincing myself to start learning to code, then it was ensuring that all of the code was formatted and the website looked nice. Coming up with the word combination was difficult, as was ensuring that the link looked as much like  single hyperlink as possible. \n that I'm proud of\n Finally got around to learning to code, and am now looking forward to  on many more exciting projects.  proud to have come up with the idea and then g on to execute it. Proud that it was all written in actual code rather than just editing the words on wordpress as I usually do with my website.\nWhat I learned\n How to  html/css. How to create headings, change font sizes, import images, add hyperlinks, add image hyperlinks, reformat code to become  sentence,  continuously for a few hours without procrastinating. \n Online Magic Trick - Amaze Your Friends\n Definitely going to design some more magic tricks that  can do for their friends  the platform.

We  learned how to create a GUI interface in Android Studio, an IDE with which we had no experience at all for creating apps - in fact, we created our first ever mobile app here at OxfordHack.\n FineType\nFineType's next steps would be to smooth the  experience by reducing the amount of errors that come from unexpected diagonal movement, smoothing the amount of noise experienced by the app from random movement, and adding features like capitalization, spacing, and repeating characters in a row.",

In this game the character has to follow game hints that lead to the player answering the ph to a friend who sends information about the location of a portal to a magical world. The way 3d graphics engines  greatly interests me so for fun, instead of  a program like unity that does the 3d for you, for this project I aimed to create a 3d game  just JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, paint images and screenshots I would take of 3d objects.\n I created 3D objects  SkectchUp then screenshotted these scenery models from lots of different angles and  JavaScript and jQuery to control when these images were displayed to create a 3d game experience for the . I   Photoshop to  the images backgrounds transparent where appropriate. The game includes some third person scenes in which the players width and height is multiplied by scalar values based on its y-coordinate to create perspective and show when the player is close or far away. This scene  includes some quick first person moments which occur when an object of great importance to the games story appears and the  is able to view this item in first person. This was d to  sure the  sees this object up close and notices it. As the player opens the portal the world distorts a bit to empathise the magical powers of the portal. Magic dust  appears above the flashing portal. Once the portal is opened the magical world is all in first person. The player is transported to a magical castle which they can freely walk up and down  corridor of. The corridor appears clear at first but as soon as the player starts to walk an enchanted floating hat appears. \nWhen making the game I came across many .  of these was that the number of screenshots needed to  a smooth running 3D game was too large. I had to compromise and limit the number of images  to a reasonable number. I  struggled with problems ca by code written for different stages of the game affecting thing in a part of the game they were not intended for. The solution to this was to give each stage of the game a boolean variable that tracks if it should have started running yet or not.

Who would actually be  this product?\nThe operator is going to be the agencies trying to let the spaces in the buildings. The  would be any interested in occupying the building. We do not  assumptions about the technical abilities of either of these s. Hence we needed to devise something which was intuitive to , but not too difficult to set up. Virtual reality is  option, as it allows the potential occupier to 'walk' around the office, and get a real feel for the size.\nWe couldn't  an Oculus Rift. Here's why:\n\nIt requires a computer with exceptional graphics ability\nIt requires some with technical knowledge to set up\nIt is relatively expensive\nThe wires can be very cumbersome\n\nWe decided to go instead with the Google Cardboard:\n\nIt s a ph. Most  in business have a ph capable of creating VR scenes.\nThe setup is minimal. You launch an app and the experience is setup\nGoogle Cardboard costs \u00a35 -- A more comfortable Homido costs \u00a350.\n\n\nThere are two parts to the system, the website, and the mobile application.\nThe Website\nThe Website is for  by the operator - the building space retailer. It provides a very simple interface which allows the  to draw out the scene, and then see a very basic visualisation of how the scene might look in three dimensions. It provides options for visualising the scene, clearing any mistakes, and sending the data over to the mobile application.\nThe Application\nThe mobile application was built for Android, and allowed the display to be configured for Virtual Reality. With simplicity in mind, the  only needs to launch the app, request the data from the website with a simple click, then put the ph in the headset to have a look around.\n\nThe Website\nThe website was developed with the standard suite of web languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For the CSS, we  Bootstrap to ensure that there was a consistent style guide, and to  the webpage pseudo-responsive. For the 3D modelling and display, we  three.js to provide a JavaScript wrapper for OpenGL. We   jQuery to send AJAX requests to build the API.\nWe took the following approach to building the website:\n\nDesign and create the layout\nHave the 3D visualisation  for a fake input matrix\nCreate a grid matrix to feed into the visualisation\nCreate the API which can then be read by the mobile application\n\nThe Application\nThe application was build with Unity, which provides tools to create Virtual Reality scenes. The application connected to the API and downloaded a matrix representing the geometry of the space. It then goes through the matrix and procedurally generates the space.

Then open the 'listen' page on another device and you'll be able to hear the amplified guitar playing - no wires between the two!\nHow I built it\nIt s the Web Audio API to get the input from the guitar, which effectively acts like a microph when plugged into the ph.

Having previously  Socket.io many times, I thought it would be a good idea to  their p2p module to stream the audio. In the end it ed out okay, but the documentation was a bit rubbish.\nAnother major issue is the latency.

There's a very simple (18 lines of code) back end written in PHP. The front end is stylised  bootstrap.\n I ran into\nYouTube doesn't allow all videos to be embedded, due to the various different licensing arrangements they have - so I had to  sure my web app took this into account and didn't offer s videos which were unplayable. I designed a bespoke events protocol  pusher to synchronise clients \"peer to peer\" - all the back end does is authorise connections (all connections are automatically authorised, however pusher requires connections to be authorised  a back end before they can broadcast data).\nUnfortunately my web app doesn't yet  on mobile due to issues with automatically playing / pa videos (see the YouTube documentation for more information). I hope that this issue can be overcome in the near future.\n that I'm proud of\nIt all s fairly smoothly. The  interface is quite friendly, and is looks reasonably nice. This was my first \"major\" (4+ hours of coding time) project  JavaScript - it's a good way to write cross-platform applications.\nWhat I learned\nI learned how to write a substantial application  JavaScript, and how to  Pusher without having a central backend to keep track of state. I think this is really ful - by  client-side programming and peer-to-peer communication costs are kept to a minimum and applications are generally scalable by nature.\n ShareLive\nThere are a few items on the to do list. I'd really like to integrate with Spotify instead of YouTube, as Spotify offers greater music choice and higher sound quality. Access to their APIs is by application / invitation only, so hopefully this proof-of-concept can show that this is a good idea.",

We drew artistic  from games such as \"Gods  Be Watching\" and \"The Secret of Monkey Island\" - and loosely based our primary game mechanic on... \"Papers, Please\" and... maybe \"Guess Who\"? With hindsight, the game turned out rather similar to Sheffield's Assassin's Guild society - and as two of our developers are indeed members, this is PROBABLY not coincidence. Call it subconscious game design, or whatever floats your boat.\n\"The Dossier\" was a game designed to combine the talents of our four developers. We decided on a video game, as this is where the majority of our cumulative experience lies - video game development. Rather than limiting us, this let us draw from a dauntingly vast pool of disciplines that making a decent game requires. Art, programming, web development, and creative writing - we split our team of four rather neatly into these four different categories.\n\n\nThe Dossier features intrigue, espionage, and pirates. Put simply, there's a load of characters in a room -  of whom is your \"target\". Equipped with a rather vague \"briefing file\", along with each character's dialogue and appearances, you are tasked with identifying your target correctly.\nThe quicker you  a correct identification, the more points you score - and after five rounds of investigation, your score is uploaded to an online leaderboard. We've  got functionality to post your score to twitter, beca social media.\n\nOh, and did we mention that we composed and arranged an entire soundtrack for The Dossier? (A 15 second chip-tune loop, don't get excited.)\n\nThe game itself was developed in the Game r engine,  GML (Game r Language), whilst the assets were hand drawn in a image editor called \"Krita\". Tying everything together were various Google Drive folders and documents, which  found themselves spontaneously filled with tonnes and tonnes of god-awful character dialogue - as if from thin air...\n\nLast but by no means least, we  HTML, CSS, and PHP to get the online leaderboard up and running.\n\nCoding wise, matching up the sprite animations with the character movement, alongside varying the game with each play (random characters chosen from a pool of possibilities), proved to be something of a timesink.\nRegarding asset creation, the large load for a project of this nature made it difficult to produce content fast enough. We were able to overcome this through re- many of our assets - modifying the originals to  them unique.\nFinding a web hosting service proved tricky, to say the least. This, combined with a mid-hackathon fresh OS install, set the leaderboard development a little behind other aspects of the game.\n\n\nAll of us on the team, having never ed together before, were able to successfully meet the load of the game we designed from the beginning. It was stressful at times, and plain tedious at others, but we unanimously pulled through and were to deliver a game that lived up to our expectations.\n\n\nThe most significant thing we learned was that: allocating roles is effective. The four of us ed on very different, equally important aspects of the project, but maintained communication throughout. In this way, we made progress on our individual tasks, whilst helping each other and making design decisions as a group.\n\n The Dossier\nWhilst we don't intend to continue developing The Dossier, we certainly learned a lot from its development, and find it likely that we'll collaborate again on a future project.",

We're not quite sure ourselves. Our initial idea was to build a world thanks to leap motion, shaping it like clay with our own hands. Instead we ended with a political satire. Why create a world when you can effortlessly destroy the walls built by a real-life evil?\n\nIt's a wall. Which you destroy. With your hands.\nWow\n\nWith a lot of pain and boring tutorial videos. We only spent about four hours on it, the rest was mainly learning.\n\nLiterally all of them. \"the software I've been  for the past three hours was the wrong \" \"the actual software doesn't want to open properly\" \"there are no online resources for our situation\" \"my computer doesn't \" \"wait did half of our group casually left five hours in?\" etc etc etc\n\nWe built a wall!\n\nThe... power of friendship?

However, after some brainstorming, we have decided to allow any of the s to be able to submit a location to find. This way, the first player to find that location would get points. We decided to scrap the idea of QR codes, as these would be too much of a hassle to print out for every , especially if only  player would be able to  the code afterwards. Instead, a player who finds  of the locations marked has to take a picture of it, and wait for the approval of the original poster of the location. If it is approved, the  is rewarded with 10 points. As the icon of the game if a camera with an arrow through it, we decided to call the points \"arrows\".\nWe have been considering several platforms for the game, but in the end we chose to  the application  XCode in the language Swift, as we had a team member with a lot of prior experience. We  distributed jobs for the rest of us, with  of us sketching and making the design, and  team member researching the back-end database.\nWe ran into several . First of all, finding a good solution for the back-end was difficult without a good understanding of XCode and Swift. In the end, we decided to  a service called Quickblox, with allowed us to create a database and  manage the data in the application. Another challenge we ran into was the time limit, as even though we tried our best to keep , we had to scrap some features that we had been considering originally, such as having locations displayed on a map, which would have been a nice extra feature, however it was unfeasible given the time we had.\nEach of us have learned new skills, as we have all been  with tasks we had never d before.  understanding the importance of communication was important, and I strongly believe we each became closer to each other as friends.\nIf we were to continue developing this application in the future, we would add other features such as preventing s from finding the chosen locations of the same player more than once or twice, to ensure cheating would be difficult. , we would implement a map feature, to  locations easier to find around the city, by giving a radius on the map to show hints about where the locations are.\nOverall, we each enjoyed this experience, and definitely learnt new skills, and just had fun  together generally.",

Most of the bugs I encountered were usually due to something not being painted or made visible at the right time. \n that I'm proud of\nI am most proud of the boss fight, which was coded much more blindly (the boss moves differently to the other enemies and is the only  who can fight back, as well as the only  who can withstand a large amount of hits, and change his movement appropriately when hurt).\nWhat I learned\nI learned some basic game development techniques which  surely come in ful later on in my career.

The bot responds with a welcome and instructions. Commands such as Start, Stop, Next, allow the  to begin a new 14 day intro to the Bible reading plan. The bot  auto send you todays reading each day and keep track of what reading your are currently on. The bot  accepts voice commands  WeChat's built in voice recognition. The voice recognition currently only s for mandarin Chinese, however our app is multilingual and can accept these Chinese voice commands without issue.\n \nIn addition to the reading plan, s can ask basic questions such as 'What is God like?', 'Who is Jesus?', 'Who is the Holy Spirit?', and 'What is love?'. Questions that do not have automatic responses are forwarded to another WeChat  who can send a response back. This person could be a pastor or spiritual leader. The bot is  able to receive voice message responses.\n \nThe Gospel Guide bot can respond with Bible text lookups. Simply send a message containing a Bible verse, chapter, or range, and the bot  send you the full text. If you would like more information about a verse or passage you can send a mesage containing keywords such as 'explain', 'I don't understand', 'commentary' followed by a scripture passage and the bot  send you a link to a Bible commentary on that passage!\n\n\nMultilingual English/Chinese\n\n\n\n\nWe built the Gospel Guide bot  Python, Flask, and Redis running on a Heroku.com server.\n\nOverall, the coding went smoothly.

Being discriminated against for being who you are and being denied access to bathroom and other services beca of that was something we were not too fond of. We took it upon ourselves to help out members of this wonderful community, more specifically those who are homeless and tech savvy, and created something that is so simple to  in an attempt to connect them to services that they seek.\n\nOur app connects those without wifi-access to gender neutral restrooms and charging outlets nearby. All that the  has to do is text our ph number.\n\nWe built our services  twilio, api.ai and different apis we  from sites like refugerestrooms.org and google places. We then integrated intents within api.ai and connected them to our twilio ph number that would then bring about information from the cloud in heroku which sent back information from refugerestrooms.org and google places.\n I ran into\nTraining our intents was a bit difficult for there are millions of ways that an interaction can take place between our s and our bot. , connecting places nearby with s in need, and training our bot to know whether an establishment is open or not took some digging.\n that I'm proud of\nWe are proud to be able to to reach out and impact that lives of those in deed.

At the end of the days we are all humans, created equally and we should strive to always help those in need. There is nothing more rewarding than to be able to create something that can benefit the lives of others'.\n LooBot\nWe started LooBoot 2 weeks prior to demo day.

Naturally, we clicked on #HB2 on Twitter, expecting to browse through personal perspectives shared online; to our disappointment, we only saw coverage by national media outlets and personal narratives were few and far between. This is due to Twitter\u2019s algorithm prioritizing crowd traffic over individual voices and the same phenomenon is seen across the modern media landscape. This made us interested in creating a impact sharing platform designed to feature individual LGBT voices.\nThe more we brainstormed the idea, the more we realized the potential value these shared stories could have as a vehicle for political advocacy\u2014so we began to investigate how we might introduce advocacy features into the app. As we aimed to improve on what\u2019s available today, we examined the shortcomings of advocacy organizations and platforms like the Human Rights Campaign and the White Ho\u2019s We The . We saw that we could create a more agile, strategic and purposed tool for LGBT personal advocacy.\n\nSpeakout provides consumer-facing apps that empower citizens to share their personal stories and see the personal stories of others who are impacted by LGBT legislation. Through the app, it amplifies their voices and  encourages them to contact their elected representatives. \nThe server  provides API access that could provide valuable insight for NGOs interested in the perspectives of everyday LGBT  whose perspectives provide valuable research. \n\nEddie designed the wireframes, built the iPh application  Swift, and built the server and API  Firebase as the backend. Leonard developed the Android app. We stayed in regular contact so we could collaborate on the broader mission and  sure our respective projects aligned. \n\nWe ran into many technical  (implementing authentication, connecting to the backend, parsing data). \nWe  ran into  deciding how to our s could present themselves on the app. For political advocacy, it is often most effective to have official names and official addresses on petitions. But for many in our community, official names may not be how we see ourselves, and sharing their addresses may impact their safety. For this reason, we have made it open-ended what  can choose to share. \n\nWe\u2019re proud of completing two apps, creating a server, implementing live data from the Sunlight Foundation and Google\u2019s Civic API -- and in less than 9 weeks!\n\nLeonard learned a lot about Android development, including implementing fragments, implementing images and interacting with servers. \n Speakout\nWe would love to  directly with an LGBT rights organizations (domestic or international) interested in gaining the perspective of LGBT  on a specific issue, then  Speakout to empower that community to be heard.",

Previously, reports were emailed out and and analysed on an hour by hour basis on energy managers computers locally, manually. Reports then had to be created by looking at this data and manually finding out statistics from it to then report on. We could see this was a clear problem and so, we built a cloud-based dashboard to automate the process entirely.\nFeatures and Benefits\n\nHalf hourly energy usage reports are automatically input when received as email attachments at a specific email address once per day - therefore no changes to existing infrastructure are needed whatsoever to allow our solution to be  day-to-day by real life energy managers.\n\u2018Energy concerns\u2019 are automatically highlighted by looking at sharp changes in numbers on a week-on-week per-site basis.\nSites can then be viewed in detail and have their usage, averages, and costs, displayed in a table and graphed.\nSites  have a \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 status generated by our week-on-week analysis algorithm, so energy managers can see wether a particular site is becoming more or less efficient instantly.\nA report can be generated that contains running bi-weekly data, analysed  our per-site week-on-week algorithm, so that energy managers can instantly see the most improving and most deteriorating sites, along with average weekly usage change and average weekly cost change for all sites that they manage.",

    "project_description": "\nTwo devices, two different  experiences, too much hassle\nAt the beginning, our  came from a simple issue: when  a desktop or laptop computer to access a website, all of the functionality of our smartphs and/or tablets wasn't being . Mobile devices have become ubiquitous as easily accessible and multi-functional portable computers. These devices, having access to a wide array of sensors (such as cameras, gyroscopes, gps, etc.) are capable of quickly providing various types of data to websites.\nHowever, when  our desktops to browse the internet, we are incapable of accessing all of our ph's functionality! We cannot utilize the extra screen space of our ph, nor can we provide data from our ph's sensors to the website. Hence, we came up with the idea for a service that could link the functionality of mobile devices with traditional full-size computers. (And we named it AquaPoodle beca why not?) \n\nAquaPoodle Transfer (hence referred to as APT) is our proof of concept for a web service that can take data from a mobile device and provide it to a desktop or laptop computer in a simple and accessible manner. To allow a  to send data from  device to another, there are three primary steps:\n\n Establish a linkage between the mobile device and the computer  a QR code, \n Provide a mobile site to prompt the mobile device to obtain some data, and \n Send the data from the mobile device to the computer. \n\n\nThe actual implementation of APT is fairly involved. Here we  break down the primary steps into the actual code involved.\nEstablishing a linkage:\nEnsuring that the 's mobile device and computer are linked requires a lengthy process of developing a unique session ID and then passing it from the computer to the mobile device with a QR code. To achieve, this, the unique ID must traverse the hierarchy of the code, from the web service down to the mobile device.\nTo begin the external web service generates a unique ID hashed from the mac address of the computer, the current time, and an internal device counter. The   utilize a chrome extension that  then receive the unique ID. From there, the external web interface develops a QR code based on the URL that the mobile device  navigate to, and the unique ID. The QR code is then provided to the chrome extension. The  then scans this QR code with their mobile device's camera. At this point, the chrome extension and the mobile device both have the same unique ID. \n\nPrompting the mobile device:\nPrompting the mobile device to provide some data, in this case a photo, is achieved by navigating to a URL that contains javascript that provides the appropriate prompt. This URL is contained in the QR code referred to earlier. Here, assuming an android device is being , the  may choose to provide a photo in the mobile device's storage, or to take a new photo. In either case, the photo is sent via a post to the server, which then caches it.\nSending data to the computer:\nFinally, the server can take the cached photo data (here encoded in base 64) and send it through a post to the 's chrome extension. The chrome extension then decodes the photo data and displays it in the toolbar to then be  where appropriate.\n\nSO MANY PROBLEMS PLEZ HALP\nWe ran into an inane number of issues over the course of our 24 hours of coding, which are compiled here:\n\nChrome extension errors: Numerous issues arose from finding out how to  a chrome extension interact with an external server and update accordingly. Many google help pages were queried.\nUncountable number of server errors: There was a constant fight against server errors as we slowly but steadily ed our way through syntax and configuration problems, fueled by coffee, red bull and Huel(TM). We tried to host our server on AquaPoodle.com but the domain provider eated it (T_T) .\nSession IDs that are not so unique: Determining a way to  session IDs that wouldn't clash required some trial and error as we logically decided which unique values could be  to  session IDs. \nAndroid apps that don't compile: We attempted to develop an app that would provide the functionality achieved by the mobile site provided through a URL in the QR code. Achieving this proved to be infeasible for the amount of time available, as  through the complex syntax of the Android code API and implementing a separate library to read scanned QR codes was just too much.\n\n that we are proud of\n\n\nImplementing an external library in Android code API to (nearly) provide functionality with reading barcodes or QR codes.\nHosting our own server!\nCreating a functional chrome browser extension!\nHaving fun and not losing our sanity!!\n\n\nAlthough we learned tons about javascript and server hosting, our most important development was how to  as a team. Splitting the load efficiently, organizing meeting times and  together with synergy was highly rewarding and essential to our success.\n APT\n early example we envisid was to display a 's shopping cart for a given webpage on their ph, and then allow them to select items from the ph shopping cart to navigate to the appropriate webpage on their laptop or desktop. Given the chance to extend APT, we would like to  on extending the functionality to be more generalized, and at a further point in development,  an API of this code to provide more possibilities with sharing data between mobile and full webpages, so that the first idea could be possible.",

The best piece of hardware to facilitate this was the Myo Armband.\n\nOur app currently takes a constant stream of data from the Myo's 8 muscle activity sensors and translates it into data about each muscle group that it is connected to. We consider that even though the current prototype shows only real-time data, the access to that data allows us to add a multitude of features in the future.\n\nOur app is built in Android Studio,  Java. We tried to abide to the material design rules as much as we could.\n\n of the main  that we had is the Android SDK for Myo doesn't expose the raw data for the 8 muscle activity sensor. Thankfully the open source community came to our rescue, and we found a project that implemented an API that exposed the data we needed. \nThe other challenge was in aggregating the individual sensor data so that we match it to the individual statement. \n\nWe made a  product that might be commercially viable\n\nAndroid development and interacting with hardware\n Myo Athletics\nWe'll add more features in the future like:\n\nExercise history\nExercise templates\nIntegrating other body parts and maybe other hardware like the Nike+",

So we came up with an idea to solve this problem with all the desktops and spaces being projected in 3D on your ph  the fantastic Google Cardboard.\n\nIt basically runs on your local machine and local net and captures all the active spaces on your computer and transmits them to our Android application where you  it with the help of Google Cardboard to project every space in virtual reality. These spaces keep on refreshing so that you can get a real time view of your desktop.\n\nFor the front end of the application we have  Unity along with Google Cardboard SDK for Unity 3D. For this Unity project we have  certain GameObjects which run on C# scripts to query the back end and get the latest update of the desktop screens and space. Whereas on the back end we run a node.js server which streams the images which are captured from X11  FFMpeg.\n\nThe basic idea was to  Android Studio but then we switched to Unity after a great talk by David. But n of our team members had experience in Unity so we had to learn everything from the basics, learn C# etc. Another challenge was to refresh the stream constantly so that we don't miss out on anything going on. On the back end it was tough streaming the images correctly and efficiently.\n\nFirst accomplishment would be not sleeping for almost 24 hours. Second would be to pick up a new programming language in a day and  something ful with it. Learning new software and SDK from scratch.\n\nWe learned C#, Unity and core features of Linux to capture the image.

My mind connected with the jobs data, understanding how engineers are sent out for maintenance but might abort the job due to lack of information about was needed. That engineer might not bother to accurately record why they aborted the job, or even if finished they might not record what they did.\nI could have reviewed the data, running queries to flag up places issues commonly happen and I could have written a report on how good it was. That's my day job, and as this is a hackathon I wanted to see how my coding would follow my wandering mind. I  wanted to think how engineers and team leaders could be engaged with gaps in data and a potential domino effect. Simply pointing out which engineers/jobs had bad data, wasn't enough.\n\nMy hacked-together project takes all the jobs associated to an asset. It then paints different aspects of the jobs onto a \"flag\" image. The human mind can easily spot patterns, and most importantly breaks in patterns. [see annotated flag] An asset may get jobs every few months and that be normal, but at  point there is is a job that was only a few days after the following job. That can draw us in, and perhaps every time the pattern breaks it is after an orange dot which means no comment was given.\nThe real benefit is the view of assets. The idea is that NWL staff  be able to filter the list of assets (or generating reports) in the way they are  to, I have just hard-coded some examples. For example, show all assets with more than had more than 40 jobs, or show pump assets. On this page, the \"flag\" images of each asset are shown. Beca the filter has selected assets of an specific nature, the flags are likely to be the same. For example the time-since-last-job bar may be all greens beca the assets are reliable s maintained every 5 years. It is not the individual assets to look at, but the typical pattern of these flags and then you can see where there are breaks.\nHow I built it\nThe data was converted from Excel into CSV and into a mySQL database, thanks to critical help from Simon and his patience waiting for conversions to run. When the detail page of an asset is looked at, PHP runs some queries on the tables to get various data of the jobs. The GD image library is  to draw different shapes onto a grey rectangle. There is nothing amazing to this build, but I hadn't spent a lot of time with the GD functions before as previous  had started with images rather than create them from scratch. My main  was reviewing the data, and learning what the field names were.\n I ran into\nConverting the data had it's problems. Large Excel files are horrible, CSV is better.\nI was aware of limited time, and thus limited opportunity I had. I didn't push myself to build a big  interface, and that actually resulted in me skipping on another project idea I started forming. \n that I'm proud of\nVisualising about 50 rows on a 300 x 100 pixel image, displaying those on a page/gird, and thus being able to visualise multiple tables/queries of a relational database on such a flat view. Normally such a view would require flicking between tabs/sheets and keeping in mind what each  looked like and how they linked.\nPlaying with the GD image library was a fun accomplishment, but it's only the start.\nWhat I learned\nGD library has some bugs in it that limited what I could draw, I may be able to get around those. I've been able to learn about specific assets that stood out as a result of the flag images, although I'm not a domain-expert to know exactly what  that means or confirm it is something that isn't right.\n Abstract Assets\nUnderstanding the values is important, and although advice is on hand it would need a lot of sit-down time to see what is relevant. The break points for shapes changing colour, and what information to display could be tweaked and  adjusted.  of the things to add next would be a marker as to the priority-level of jobs. The image could  display information about the asset that isn't job-specific.",

It allows for adding descriptions to the tasks too.\n\nWe  css for the style of the webpage, then we  javascript for the client-side scripting along with the jquery plugin for increased functionality.

Though this was guaranteed as secure, it did not  and we later realised we would have to code the login in php. To prevent a compromise on security, this took a rather long amount of time, and we faced many bugs too, so before we knew it, it was past midnight and all we really had was a login.

However, this idea was quickly sidelined by the arrival of the MLH hardware lab and the realisation that I had bought my Passport. The next few hours were spent renting out a selection of hardware, from Oculus Rifts to Leap Motions, and we quickly came up with the idea of a virtual keyboard that allowed you to type in midair  the Leap Motion. But we had little success with tracking individual fingers with enough accuracy so we attempted to  the Thalmic Myo to create a morse code keyboard but we  ran into problems. So, driven by our aim to actually finish a hack within 24 hours we returned to Hackindr.\n\nHackindr is a mobile and web app that allows s to like or dislike random hackathon ideas, see the top ten ideas and submit their own.\n\nFirstly, we built a REST API  Python, Flask and Postgres which was deployed on Heroku. We then connected this to our native Android app written into Java. We then built a web interface, originally  Angular, but ended up being built in Node.js and Express.js and hosted on Heroku. Finally, we  began to  on an iOS version  Swift.\n\nAfter encountering problems with Thalmic Myo and Leap Motion we were hoping for Hackindr to relatively problem free, however, this was not the case. Our first major problem was when the backend suddenly stopped accepting valid names and passwords which was solved by turning it off and on again. Our next problem was trying to figure out how to  HTTP requests in Swift which was eventually solved. Additionally, we encountered a nearly infinite series of NullPointerExceptions in Android app which were mostly ca by ourselves accidently deleting lines in our sleep deprived haze.\n\nOverall, we are really impressed by the fact we actually finished our hack with the web and android versions  before 9am.",

Every is given a specific topic (eg. Video Games) and the audience must all submit  or more websites which they think are related to the given topic.

    "project_description": "Inception\nAs the team formed during the #HackTrain2015, our combination of skills and interests led us to tackle the problem of real-time crowd counting and seat availability during train journeys in the UK. Vadim had prior experience  with beacons technology, Nick is already a hackathon war-hero and veteran, Marius is the laser-foc web-dev guy and myself, well, I'm soaking all that we're doing. Be it through business modelling, joining dev talks, searching for resources or APIs or writing our story. \nAs it unravels.\nwaveRoll is a solution to  big pain point from UK's rails industry: counting in real-time the  from each carriage during a journey. Based on this, it can provide business insights for the train operators and it can  tell passengers where there is a high probability that they can get a seat. Before they board.\n\nWe actually started having in mind the two elements, the silverrail API capabilities and the iBeacons techology. After quickly sketching up the requirements for a webAPI, talking about microservices, scalability, we thought more in depth about how we might get this in front of company executives and travellers alike.\nGetting into the core of waveRoll, there are a few considerations to be made. First, the analytics system is built around the Apache Kafka high-throughput messaging system, which is designed to efficiently aggregate massive amounts of data; its distributed nature allows capacity to be added simply by allocating nodes. \nFor data at rest, we are  ElasticSearch as our storage engine, which is similarly distributed and resilient. In a massive real-world deployment, we would likely abandon this prototype in favour of a higher performance database such as PostGreSQL\n\nWho doesn't love random technical incongruences on a Saturday evening during a 60h+ hackathon?\nThe actual JSON that we were receiving from the silverrail API, our beloved sponsor, was in the wrong format. The coordinates were almost unusable, save for a brilliant algorithm furiously typed by Nick, chief-in-hackathon. \nNow, I'm not saying that this was our best accomplishment. The actual greatness was for all 120 of us to be here, building and iterating over ideas. Beginners and artisans alike, contributing towards a palpable progress within an entire industry. In less than 3 days.\nWhat awaits team waveRoll\nAs of now, we're still inching away in developing our beloved creation, making waveRoll robust and foc on solving a single paint point. \nIt's tomorrow when we'll demo it and all the cards  fall into place. For me, it already is a crazy learning experience which I  never forget. My only hope is that someday, I  be able to pass over what I've learned now to some who, like me today, was given a chance to see product development at its best.",

They practically have the same conditions. Well, it's beca they are in good company with friends and other  who celebrate the same thing. Why cant we have this kind of environment for trains? We want to start piering that shift of mindset through our app ChatPoint.\n\nChatPoint is an application that encourages customers to socialize with others on a train by providing them a platform to chat with other  they could possibly get along with.\nHow I built it\n JavaScript at the client side to display data and node.js on the server side to manage distribution of messages.\nAdvantage to the customer\nMost customers described their train rides as \"long\", \"dull\", and \"boring\".\nAnd contrary to popular belief, they do talk to other  on the train. But only if the coversation was started by the other person.\nWe found it interesting that only 2 out of the 12  we physically approached declined a chat with us for the survey.\nMost of them are open to chatting especially when they are interested on the topic. \nChat point would be a great tool for them to pass their time on the train.\nAdvantage to TOC's\n data\nSince we have a huge collection of customer data, train companies can now adjust certain strategies accordingly. For example some months could be lean seasons and some unknown tourist destinations could only have a few passengers.\nThrough the app's backend analytics, you could see patterns of certain type of  who  the trains that you couldn't have guessed normally. So you could adjust the marketing accordingly.\nYou could  see patterns of 's behaviour and their sentiments so you could  adjust operations accordingly.\nAdditional Revenue\nWe would have certain chat topics that are sponsored by brands and  would get certain perks if they participate in the discussion such as a discount on the ticket or in shops. So it's kind of an ad but not really beca based on their likes,  would want to participate in the discussion.\nBased on our survey, the 70% of yes' was raised to 93% when the concept of discounts was introduced.",

As a voiced based application, we focussed on an ultra-high accuracy of speech-to-text transcription  Google's new web speech API. The accuracy is above 90% for most accents and  cases, and we achieved 100% accuracy for most tests and common queries. IBM's Natural Language classifier service, a part of the Bluemix basket of Watson service, then run the transcribed speech through a classifier that we trained to recognize common customer queries at kiosks such as route finding, ticket purchasing and ticket printing based on a pre-booked purchase and reference number. The confidence index for most results returns by the classifier is over 98% due to the extraordinarily well trained, machine learning service that we built and integrated.  Once queries are classified, the Dialog AI service from Watson is  to provide a fast and accessible interaction with the customer to buy tickets, see route information or print pre-booked tickets.

They're often difficult to find, but we can tell you how to get there. These are the secrets that the tourists don't know about, but they're always magical.\nWith this hack, we want to tackle this problem and scale the solution. Not every has a friend in the country that they want to go visit - Further becomes that trusted friend in your pocket. \nHow it s:\nLocals share their experiences, so that Travellers can experience places like a local. Travellers pay a small fee to access the full itinerary of items and the locals get paid for sharing their knowledge.\nWhy we're different:\nWhere a startup like Hype is about advice from locals for locals, and another startup called Esplorio is about advice by tourists for tourists - Further solves the problem through local knowledge for tourists.\nIn our online webapp:\nA local goes online to write an experience, they log in and see their dashboard.\nThey want to create a new experience, so they add a title, categories, summary & a heads up of a budget if the experience is likely to cost the traveller something.\nThe local then adds  the items - the step by step bits of the day. These nuggets include how to get there, where to eat, what to take with and when to go. Locals include the tips they feel are important to the experience. \nWhen the local is d, the experience goes live. The local then sees a dashboard to view the experiences they have uploaded. Since the experiences are sold for a small fee, the locals can see & manage their revenue. The locals get 80% of the amount paid by the travellers and we get 20%. It is a marketplace business model with the potential to become subscription based too.\nIn our mobile app:\nAndreas\u2019s Nordic twin Brother Andrs (who likes cats) wants to go to Cyprus. \nHe logs into the app, where he\u2019ll find the experiences he's bought. For this trip he wants a new experience so he heads over to Search & Discover. \nHe selects Cyprus & chooses a few categories, like romantic, beach, sunshine, coastal. Out of the suggestions, he chooses the experience he wants and looks at the summary. He decides to purchase and gets access to the full experience. \nDuring the experience, he can check his watch for full access to the details of the experience as the final step in a truly multiplatform travel experience. \nExpand your horizons.

    "project_description": ", Background, current Problems\nAirline Business is very advanced today, comparing to the 60's but still far from perfection.\nAirlines say they charge change fees and cancellation penalties to give travelers incentives to purchase full-fare, unrestricted tickets and to limit no-shows for flights, reducing the need to overbook. By paying higher prices, travelers can buy flexibility and avoid change fees/surcharges, where lower prices represent a trade-off, with more restrictions.\nThe Airlines take advantage of that and collect over $2 Billion every year just from the US travellers just on cancellation fees.\nMillions of travellers are disappointend and hurt by harsh cancellation fees, booking restrictions and charges.\nToday's technological advancement can allow the airlines become FAIRER to their clients and approach their problems and needs!\nExamples where companies stimulate bookings and consumer stimulation are:\n\nHRS.de - now you can cancel your accommodation booking till 6 pm same day without any cancellation charge.\n of the signs of change is that British Ariways already allow you to change your ticket name for an additional GBP 30 fee.\nThe bookings were not possible through a 3rd party company (besides travel agencies) before PAYPAL has succeeded in establishing a firm position with more flexibe payments worldwide.\n\nIf the airlines do not keep their lion's share of travellers in fear of high fees for cancellations and unaffordable prices for flights it  give them an opportunity for continuous market growth and higher revenues with ever more happy clients.\nSome of the advanced insurance companies start to pay back my to their clients, if the latter do not have accidents in a longer period of time. This transforms their clients into permanent and happy clients.\nHow it s\nOur goal is to generate a product of RADICAL CHANGE (not incremental ).\nTherefore we suggest to the Airline companies a possible cooperation with AIRMAX, that  generate great yields for both businesses and consumers on a new level.\nThe AIRMAX app rips the data from all forwarded emails with flight and accommodation confirmations to TripCase.\nOnce the  opens the APP he can see all his recent open bookings.\nHe can choose  and post it in form of a blogpost on the AIRMAX wall of offers.\nThe  can choose what he prefers: a swap, a sale or both options.\nAIRMAX charges through PAYPAL the clients that BUY the offered booking.\nIf the Flight or Accommodation booking is swapped - AIRMAX simply transfers the client data to the original service provider and directs the buyer through PAYPAL to send the my to the person who provided the ticket.\nIn case a  wants to  a gift for some he can share his offer in Facebook/Twitter and if any likes it and the time/dates convene the person - then the gift is ready!\nBUSINESS CASE:\nAIRMAX is a bridge (trusted middleman) between the airline companies and the consumers.\nThe consumers pay a small fee each time they swap, sell or transfer the ticket.\nThe partnering airlines get a monthly lump sum payment or per each transfer (as the airline operator chooses).\nIf more and more Airlines  start implementing the AIRMAX system that  allow  swap, sell or gift their booking to another person (without speculation), this  stimulate and boost the consumer activity and in result bring more profit.\n AIRMAX - Swap, Sell or Gift your Bookings!\nContacting the Airlines Companies and the Service Facilitators to accept a new system and way of selling the tickets/making the bookings.\nThe future of Travel is maximum flexibility and less restrictions for the clients. \nGet a taste of Future with AIRMAX and help us build a more perfect travel world - fairer and less restrictive and more popular for the consumers and more profitable for the airlines!",

To overcome this, and based on the fact we limited the results to the weekend, we decided to limit the max fare for the flights to 80% of the budget, meaning we were more likely to have enough in the budget to have a hotel too.\n\nThe gradual display of results,  firebase we save the search and then as we get results we populate the results page.\nThe ease of  of the search.\n\n Lasso\nMore filters for the search.\nDon't limit the search to the next weekend, we can expand the search to be within the next 3 months, then the next year as we grow.\nAdd all transport options - in the budget include the train fares and/or taxis to and from the airport (or have them as a filter)\nBooking for the flights and hotels at the quoted prices, and eventually booking within the site.",

They  specify what kind of holiday they are saving for, which helps reinforce saving habits by visualising their goal. \nAt the same time, we allow supply side partners to  private sale offers to our savers, based on their account balance as well as holiday preferences. Since our savers are fully qualified, after all they have my in the bank for a trip, they are high value leads. , since deals are fenced in for savers, suppliers can charge less than on the internet.\n I ran into\nInterestingly, it was easier to setup a recurring my transfer than to find hotels for our savers.

Local activity providers rely on word of mouth or the cooperation with travel agencies to secure business. The travel agencies  take big margins for connecting the tourists with these activity providers.\nSome small providers try to offer their activities directly, but being hst, I've never feel completely safe. However, by connecting with providers and getting to know them as locals, I've met awesome  around the world. With the help of their feedback I came up with the idea of Sharrio. Shariio is a mobile app foc on connecting  who would like to participate in fun activities locally.\nWe give our providers the ability to post their activities, chat to interested participants within the app and connect directly with each other. Based on the review system and the ID verification feature, tourists feel safe connecting with the local providers directly, and can get an authentic experience at a lower cost. The local providers  take a much higher cut of the revenue and this s their business more sustainable.\nHow it s\nThe  connects with Facebook. Based on their location he  see all activities offered near-by including important details. Swiping right saves the activity to a favourites list and swiping left skips to the next activity offering.

The goal of the application is to help you find where you can fly and spend your trip depending on the weather forecast. Imagine you just want to get away, rest on a sunny beach and you don\u2019t want to spend millions on that. You don\u2019t want to check every beach destination you now and individually check the weather forecast, flight prices and hotel prices. SunFollower app pro- vides s for possible destinations from your origin airport togeth- er with extended flight itineraries info, weather forecast and hotels listing. Destinations are presented on a Google Map represented by current weather conditions icons. To see the details of the destination just click on it and see detailed weather forecast (temperature, weather conditions, wind speed and directions) for the following 5 days. SunFollower provides you with graph to visualise the prices for the flights for the next 5 days. You can pick a day from the graph and look for flights to see detailed itineraries and prices and actually pick a flight.\nOk, so you\u2019ve selected your flight, but since you\u2019re departing in just a few days it would be nice if the app could help you with finding a hotel for your stay. And that\u2019s what SunFollower actually does \u2013 it gets you a detailed hotel search to help you pick a perfect stay ;)\n I ran into\nWe had to connect to multiple  API's in order to find appropriate information such as airports. Sunflower connects to Sabre API's, GetYourGuide API, Yahoo Weather API through to SimpleWeatherJS library and our own bridge (middleware) which allows us to connect to Sabre API. \n that I'm proud of\nWe delivered fully fledged application during 24 hours!

The dev team was so tiny, only two persons were  on the app and finally accomplished the goal, so we are very proud of that. \nWhat I learned\nWe have learned how to  multiples APIs in order to deliver application which can support travellers. We have struggled a little bit with some technologies issues but finally all of them have been solved. \n SunFollower\nThere are two possibilities which are implemented in the app where you can book a ticket and mtise the incoming traffic.

Whatever way you choose, you  still find yourself linking that person on more social media afterwards. Why not do it in  go with an easy-to- app?\nWhat if you have to meet new  for business all the time? Then, your life turns into endless flow of business cards with no real structure and a simple way to organise it! Our app aims to become your electronic business card library and your business card on the go: search both your home and  contacts easily and have your business card with you wherever you go. Avoid the hassle with paper business cards!\nHow it s\nA person downloads an app and goes through a simple sign-up process that allows to add personal and  contacts like Facebook, LinkedIn etc. (only Email Address is implemented right now). Afterwards, the person takes a personal picture to be  for face recognition (in future, the Face Recognition library  be  filled up with profile images from added social nets). Ready to go!\nRecognising some and adding a their contacts is as easy as taking a picture of that person!\n\nFace recognition doesn't really  well - different camera configurations, different lighting or even haircut and glasses screwed up the process. Thus, in the future, we need to add more reliable identification techniques like Fingerprint recognition (when the devices are equipped appropriately) with a fallback to techniques like NFC, Bluetooth or QR Code scanning.\nHaving a centralised server for all the functionality means that we can roll out updates and have total control over the core of our app. However, it  means that the app can't function offline or if the server goes down. Meanwhile, doing Face recognition on the device is difficult due to all the SDKs out there (some of which are limited to the processor chips, e.g., Snapdragon SDK).\n Ionic and Cordova for making an app was a really good choice due to rapid view design process, but the frame sometimes behaves unexpectedly on the actual device. Lack of on-device JavaScript debugging s development quite a horrifying process.\n\nWe were advised to have a look at Parse backend-as-a-service and it ed out really great for us. Our backend server is just a single file with less than 250 lines of code!\nDoing a complex app that interacts with a server, s camera and Face recognition only by means of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript is exciting and is quite an accomplishment on its own. A couple of years ago we never could imagine  thick technology stack in such a way!\n\nWe had no prior experience in Ionic or Face recognition, so we learnt a great deal. We applied Ionic frame to bootstrap a simple cross-platform app really quickly. We discovered Parse - great alternative to managing your own database. We figured out the ins and outs of Face recognition with current technologies.\n Ice Breaker\nRefactoring! And lots of it! App in it's current state is very much a fragile prototype, so we need to improve it's code quality. Changing the app engine from Ionic to something like Xamarin.Forms (more native yet still cross-platform)  improve the performance and may give us a chance to  the some on-device Face recognition techniques.\nAdding more contact sources  always remain needed (especially right now, when we only have a single email) - integration with all the social nets like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ (for personal contacts) and LinkedIn (for  contacts) is crucial.\nWhat if you already have a collection of Business Cards? We could  Artificial Intelligence to smartly recognise your collection of paper Business Cards and automatically create an electronic entry with all the details (Name, Email, Age etc.)\nLimiting ourselves to Business Cards for  is quite boring!

Whatever way you choose, you  still find yourself linking that person on more social media afterwards. Why not do it in  go with an easy-to- app?\nWhat if you have to meet new  for business all the time? Then, your life turns into endless flow of business cards with no real structure and a simple way to organise it! Our app aims to become your electronic business card library and your business card on the go: search both your home and  contacts easily and have your business card with you wherever you go. Avoid the hassle with paper business cards!\nHow it s\nA person downloads an app and goes through a simple sign-up process that allows to add personal and  contacts like Facebook, LinkedIn etc. (only Email Address is implemented right now). Afterwards, the person takes a personal picture to be  for face recognition (in future, the Face Recognition library  be  filled up with profile images from added social nets). Ready to go!\nRecognising some and adding a their contacts is as easy as taking a picture of that person!\n\nFace recognition doesn't really  well - different camera configurations, different lighting or even haircut and glasses screwed up the process. Thus, in the future, we need to add more reliable identification techniques like Fingerprint recognition (when the devices are equipped appropriately) with a fallback to techniques like NFC, Bluetooth or QR Code scanning.\nHaving a centralised server for all the functionality means that we can roll out updates and have total control over the core of our app. However, it  means that the app can't function offline or if the server goes down. Meanwhile, doing Face recognition on the device is difficult due to all the SDKs out there (some of which are limited to the processor chips, e.g., Snapdragon SDK).\n Ionic and Cordova for making an app was a really good choice due to rapid view design process, but the frame sometimes behaves unexpectedly on the actual device. Lack of on-device JavaScript debugging s development quite a horrifying process.\n\nWe were advised to have a look at Parse backend-as-a-service and it ed out really great for us. Our backend server is just a single file with less than 250 lines of code!\nDoing a complex app that interacts with a server, s camera and Face recognition only by means of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript is exciting and is quite an accomplishment on its own. A couple of years ago we never could imagine  thick technology stack in such a way!\n\nWe had no prior experience in Ionic or Face recognition, so we learnt a great deal. We applied Ionic frame to bootstrap a simple cross-platform app really quickly. We discovered Parse - great alternative to managing your own database. We figured out the ins and outs of Face recognition with current technologies.\n Ice Breaker\nRefactoring! And lots of it! App in it's current state is very much a fragile prototype, so we need to improve it's code quality. Changing the app engine from Ionic to something like Xamarin.Forms (more native yet still cross-platform)  improve the performance and may give us a chance to  the some on-device Face recognition techniques.\nAdding more contact sources  always remain needed (especially right now, when we only have a single email) - integration with all the social nets like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ (for personal contacts) and LinkedIn (for  contacts) is crucial.\nWhat if you already have a collection of Business Cards? We could  Artificial Intelligence to smartly recognise your collection of paper Business Cards and automatically create an electronic entry with all the details (Name, Email, Age etc.)\nLimiting ourselves to Business Cards for  is quite boring! We could  the renowned iBeacon technology to implement Business Cards for Places. Why not add your favourite food place while you're there to keep track of latest updates and deals? :)",

I love how hackathon events have recently exploded in popularity, but I think that promoting access to these events in super techy (but less advantaged) areas of Europe is important.\nHow it s\nI built a web crawler (Python, scrapy package) to get hackathon locations from the last 1.5 years from the hackerleague website. This didn't actually  out (curse dynamically loaded pages!), so I had to clean and regex some raw text data.  R, I could visualise where hackathons are held across Europe and how often. \nNext, I wanted to build up a Europe-wide map of tech interest. I did this by mining tweets that had keywords such as \"hacking\", \"coding\", \"programming\" and \"analytics\" and visualising them on a map of Europe (the Twitter mining was d both  the arcgis/esi map tool and by building a Twitter bot in Python). This let me see where there exist populations of techy geeks, and allowed me to compare it to the distribution of hackathon events. \nFinally,  the arcgis tool, I could visualise economic prosperity across regions in Europe and  compare this to provision of hackathons.\n I ran into\nToo many to list. Most notable among these is the difficulty of web crawling dynamically loaded pages and the lack of documentation for fetching information from json format tweets in python. I had to  around solutions for both of these problems (good old data cleaning and regex in both cases). \n that I'm proud of\nI built my first ever web crawler, and my first ever Twitter bot! I did not actually think that I would have the time to teach myself these things and implement them within a day. Pleased with myself level: Kanye West.\nWhat I learned\nI mostly code in R, and typically only  Python for support tasks like restructuring weird data into nicer formats before I can upload it into a relational database. This project completely put me outside of my comfort z and I've learned a lot.\n Hackathon data meta-analysis\nMost importantly, I need to figure out how to properly overlay the information sources so I can  prettier visualisations and analyse them quantitatively. Quantitative information would  allow us to track any effects of holding a hackathon in less catered to and advantaged areas (example sensationalist headline: \"holding a hackathon in a poorer area increases tech-related tweets by 400% for 1 month!\").
